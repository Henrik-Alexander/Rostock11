	abstract = {Total fertility rates fell to previously unseen levels in a large number of countries beginning in the early 1990s. The persistence of {TFRs} below 1.3 raised the possibility of rapid population aging and decline. We discuss the recent widespread turnaround in so-called lowest-low-fertility countries in Europe and East Asia. The number of countries with {TFRs} below 1.3 fell from 21 in 2003 to five in 2008. Moreover, the upturn in the {TFR} was not confined to lowest-fertility countries, but affected the whole developed world. We explore the demographic explanations for the recent rise in {TFRs} stemming from fertility timing effects as well as economic, policy, and social factors. Although the current economic downturn may suppress {TFRs} in the short run, we conclude that formerly lowest-low-fertility countries will continue to see increases in fertility as the transitory effects of shifts to later childbearing become less important.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Sweden was well equipped to prevent the pandemic of {COVID}-19 from becoming serious. Over 280 years of collaboration between political bodies, authorities, and the scientific community had yielded many successes in preventive medicine. Sweden’s population is literate and has a high level of trust in authorities and those in power. During 2020, however, Sweden had ten times higher {COVID}-19 death rates compared with neighbouring Norway. In this report, we try to understand why, using a narrative approach to evaluate the Swedish {COVID}-19 policy and the role of scientific evidence and integrity. We argue that that scientific methodology was not followed by the major figures in the acting authorities—or the responsible politicians—with alternative narratives being considered as valid, resulting in arbitrary policy decisions. In 2014, the Public Health Agency merged with the Institute for Infectious Disease Control; the first decision by its new head (Johan Carlson) was to dismiss and move the authority’s six professors to Karolinska Institute. With this setup, the authority lacked expertise and could disregard scientific facts. The Swedish pandemic strategy seemed targeted towards “natural” herd-immunity and avoiding a societal shutdown. The Public Health Agency labelled advice from national scientists and international authorities as extreme positions, resulting in media and political bodies to accept their own policy instead. The Swedish people were kept in ignorance of basic facts such as the airborne {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission, that asymptomatic individuals can be contagious and that face masks protect both the carrier and others. Mandatory legislation was seldom used; recommendations relying upon personal responsibility and without any sanctions were the norm. Many elderly people were administered morphine instead of oxygen despite available supplies, effectively ending their lives. If Sweden wants to do better in future pandemics, the scientific method must be re-established, not least within the Public Health Agency. It would likely make a large difference if a separate, independent Institute for Infectious Disease Control is recreated. We recommend Sweden begins a self-critical process about its political culture and the lack of accountability of decision-makers to avoid future failures, as occurred with the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

How then do economic actors form expectations and decide how to act despite this uncertainty? This pa­ per focuses on the role played by imaginaries, narratives, and calculative technologies, and argues that the market impact of shared calculation devices, social narratives, and contin­ gent imaginaries underlines the rationale for a new form of ‘narrative economics’ and a the­ ory of fictional (rather than rational) expectations. When expectations cannot be anchored in objective probability functions, the future belongs to those with the market, political, or rhetorical power to make their models or stories count. The paper also explores the dangers of analytical monocultures and the discourse of best practice in conditions of uncertainty, and considers the link between uncertainty and some aspects of populism.},

Drawing on British examples, we argue that whereas over the past 40 years sociologists championed innovative methodological resources, notably the sample survey and the in-depth interviews, which reasonably allowed them to claim distinctive expertise to access the ‘social’ in powerful ways, such claims are now much less secure. We argue that both the sample survey and the in-depth interview are increasingly dated research methods, which are unlikely to provide a robust base for the jurisdiction of empirical sociologists in coming decades. We conclude by speculating how sociology might respond to this coming crisis through taking up new interests in the ‘politics of method’.},

These surveys have led to the expectation that, sooner or later, period fertility would recover in Europe. The most recent data from the Eurobarometer 2001 survey, however, suggest that in the German-speaking parts of Europe the average ideal family sizes given by younger men and women have fallen as low as 1.7 children.

Emerging explanations have tried to explain this trend by highlighting a potential change in the fertility preferences of more educated couples. In this article we intend to add additional elements to this explanation. Using a computational modeling approach, we show that it is still possible to simulate the weakening social gradient of fertility, in the context of steady declines in family size preferences. Our results show that one of the key drivers of the changes in the relationship between education and fertility can be found in the transition to an increasingly regulated fertility regime. As the share of unplanned births decreases over time, the negative association between education and fertility weakens and the mechanisms that positively connect educational attainment with desired fertility become dominant.},

As each child has two parents, fertility measures may be related to two distinct populations : it is not necessary to use the female population as a denominator, that of men, too, can be used. In this paper, fertility rates have been computed with the male population as a base; both period rates (for the years 1899-1974) and cohort rates (from 1880-1930) are presented in parallel with the more usual conventional female rates. The independent evolution of standardized fecundities per year in males and females and also of individual family sizes per generation which are largely affected by patterns of nuptiality during and after the two wars, not only sheds new light on classis studies of fecundity but also raises other questions.},

This complements prior research that had mainly used a period approach. We compare the mean intended number of children among young women aged 20 to 24 (born in the early 1970s), measured during the 1990s in the Fertility and Family Surveys, with data on completed fertility in the same cohorts around age 40. In a similar manner, we compare the share who state that they do not want a child with actual cohort childlessness. Our exploration is informed by the cognitive–social model of fertility intentions developed by Bachrach and Morgan (Popul Dev Rev 39(3):459–485, 2013). In all countries, women eventually had, on average, fewer children than the earlier expectations in their birth cohort, and more often than intended, they remained childless. The results reveal distinct regional patterns, which are most apparent for childlessness. The gap between intended and actual childlessness is widest in the Southern European and the German-speaking countries and smallest in the Central and Eastern European countries. Additionally, we analyze the aggregate intentions-fertility gap among women with different levels of education. The gap is largest among highly educated women in most countries studied and the educational gradient varies by region, most distinctively for childlessness. Differences between countries suggest that contextual factors—norms about parenthood, work–family policies, unemployment—shape women’s fertility goals, total family size, and the gap between them.},

Through the 1980s econometric studies had found at best a mixed, neutral or negative effect of economic conditions on fertility. Notably, Butz and Ward (1979) concluded that fertility was counter-cyclical, with fertility falling in good times, as the opportunity costs of childbearing rose. More recently, there have been signs that ﬂuctuations in fertility have been pro-cyclical, with good economic times being associated with higher birth rates, and the recent recession with lower birth rates. In this paper, we use panel methods to study short term changes in aggregate fertility and economic measures in {OECD} countries from 1976-2008. We ﬁnd indeed that fertility became positively associated with good economic conditions. Furthermore, the increasing importance of economic conditions was detected for both tempo and quantum.},

In the course of the 1990s, more than ten individuals reached 115 years or more, including Jeanne Calment who attained the age of 122 years. In low-mortality countries, the number of centenarians has doubled every decade since 1950. This dramatic increase was mainly due to periodical effects related to the drastic fall in mortality among the elderly. The fact that centenarians are survivors does not mean that they are healthy. A high prevalence of comorbidity is found, and many centenarians have survived major diseases thanks to medical treatment and surgery. It is, however, possible that the comorbidity is less serious than in younger elderly. Certain personality traits may also be important in surviving health-threatening conditions. Furthermore, a number of biological and cognitive functions seem to be well-preserved in several centenarians. The influence of the {apoEgene} and other genes involved in fundamental mechanisms illustrates that with advancing age and increasing mortality even small risks may have a substantial effect on survival to 100 years. A small proportion of long-livers may be considered as relatively autonomous, and this proportion will probably increase in the future. We are living longer and seem to postpone the terminal dependent phase to higher ages. Longevity may thus be perceived as part of our postmodern condition with its mix of pleasure and suffering.},

First, two-parent families emerge as a vulnerable group, as they experienced the largest increases in levels of stress and exhaustion, converging with those experienced by single parents. Second, a gender gap emerges during this global health crisis, with women, and particularly mothers, carrying the heaviest burdens, and having the greatest mental health declines. The findings presented here underline the empirical and substantive value of studying mental health inequality from a multidimensional perspective and over time. Based on these findings, we urge policy-makers to consider more seriously the disproportionate burdens that members of families, and women in particular, have been carrying due to the pandemic, both directly and indirectly.},

We adjust our calculations of working life expectancy for working hours, and present results for western and eastern Germany by gender, education, and occupation. While working life expectancy has increased across cohorts, we find strong regional and socioeconomic disparities. Decomposition analyses show that among males, socioeconomic differences are predominantly driven by variation in employment rates; whereas among women, variation in working hours is also highly relevant. Older eastern German women have longer working lives than older western German women, which is likely attributable to the {GDR} legacy of high female employment.},

	abstract = {Background Cigarette smoking is responsible for a massive loss of life in both developed and developing countries. This article develops an alternative to the Peto–Lopez method for estimating the number or fraction of smoking-attributable deaths in high-income countries.
Methods We use lung cancer death rates as an indicator of the damage caused by smoking. Using administrative data for the population aged 550 years from 20 high-income countries in the period from 1950 to 2006, we estimate a negative binomial regression model that predicts mortality from causes other than lung cancer as a function of lung cancer mortality and other variables. Using this regression model, we estimate smoking-attributable deaths based on the difference between observed death rates from lung cancer and expected rates among non-smokers.
Results Combining the estimated number of excess deaths from lung cancer with those from other causes, we find that among males in 1955 the smoking-attributable fraction was highest in Finland (18\%); among women, no country exceeded 1\%. By 2003, Hungary had the highest fraction of smoking-attributable deaths among males (32\%), whereas the {USA} held that position among women (24\%). Our estimates are remarkably similar to those produced by the Peto–Lopez method, a result that supports the validity of each approach.
Conclusions We provide a simple and straightforward method for estimating the proportion of deaths attributable to smoking in high-income countries. Our results demonstrate that smoking has played a central role in levels, trends and international differences in mortality over the past half century.},

            Many scholars have offered structural and ideational explanations for the fertility changes occurring around the world. This paper focuses on the influence of developmental idealism—a schema or set of beliefs endorsing development, fertility change, and causal connections between development and fertility. Developmental idealism is argued to be an important force affecting both population policy and the fertility behavior of ordinary people. We present new survey data from ordinary people in six countries—Argentina, China, Egypt, Iran, Nepal, and the United States—about the extent to which developmental idealism is known and believed. We ask individuals if they believe that fertility and development are correlated, that development is a causal force in changing fertility levels, and that fertility declines enhance the standard of living and intergenerational relations. We also ask people about their expectations concerning future trends in fertility in their countries and whether they approve or disapprove of the trends they expect. The data show widespread linkage in the minds of ordinary people between fertility and development. Large fractions of people in these six settings believe that fertility and development are correlated, that development reduces fertility, and that declines in fertility foster development. Many also expect and endorse future declines in fertility.},

This pattern, driven by changing differential fertility patterns among racial and ethnic groups, reached its apex at the mid-1990s and had almost vanished by the decade’s end. Research on first-birth timing has tended to focus on Type {II} first-birth rates and therefore has failed to identify this larger, bimodal pattern.

A central finding is that there is no obvious theoretical or empirical threshold around which period fertility would tend to stabilise. Period fertility rates usually continue falling once the threshold of replacement fertility is crossed, often to very low levels. While cohort fertility rates frequently stabilise or change gradually, period fertility typically remains unstable. This instability also includes remarkable upturns and reversals in Total Fertility Rates ({TFR}), as experienced in many countries in Europe in the early 2000s. The long-lasting trend towards delayed parenthood is central for understanding the diverse, low and unstable post-transitional fertility patterns. In many countries in Europe this shift to a late childbearing pattern has negatively affected the {TFR} for more than four decades. Many of the emerging post-transitional countries and regions are likely to experience a similar shift during the next two to three decades, often depressing their {TFRs} to very low levels.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Low fertility levels and later childbearing in many developed countries have reinvigorated the debate between period and cohort perspectives on fertility and on the meaningfulness of the period total fertility rate ({TFR}). Here, fertility-timing effects are defined as level changes in period fertility that do not reflect level changes in the completed fertility of cohorts. That definition leads to the average cohort fertility ({ACF}) as a measure of period fertility adjusted for timing effects. In an influential paper, Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) presented an alternative approach and a different measure, {TFR}*, to adjust for timing effects. Here, the two measures are compared. In the context of model populations, the {ACF} performs well, reflecting an average of the fertility of the active cohorts. The Bongaarts-Feeney {TFR}*, however, is frequently unreliable and can be erratic when there are cycles in period timing. When applied to twentieth-century U.S. experience, the {TFR}* behaves like a period measure and yields adjustments that are often wide of the mark. The {ACF} shows the stability associated with cohort measures and quantifies the substantial impact that timing effects had during the “birth dearth” of the 1970s. The period {TFR} reached a low of 1.74 in 1976, but the {ACF} never went below 2.06 during the 1970s.},

Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth outside of marriage. Recent theoretical and qualitative work at the intersection of demography and cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high, nearly unattainable, economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions. We use the events of the Great Recession, leveraging variation in the severity of the crisis between years and across states, to examine how exposure to worse state-level economic conditions is related to poor women’s likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012. In accord with theory, we find that women of low socioeconomic status ({SES}) exposed to worse economic conditions are indeed somewhat less likely to marry. However, we also find that unmarried low-{SES} women exposed to worse economic conditions significantly reduce their fertility; economic standing is not disconnected from nonmarital fertility. Our results suggest that economic concerns were connected to fertility decisions for low-{SES} unmarried women during the Great Recession.},

The upper branch consists of countries in Northern and Western Europe, Oceania and the United States; the lower branch includes Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, and East and Southeast Asia. A review of the major theories for low fertility countries reveals that none of them would have predicted this specific bifurcation. We argue that those countries with fertility levels close to replacement level have institutional arrangements, and related policies, that make it easier, not easy, for women to combine the worker and mother roles. The institutional details are quite different across countries, suggesting that multiple combinations of institutional arrangements and policies can lead to the same country-level fertility outcome. Canada, the only exception to this bifurcation, illustrates the importance of the different institutional structures in Québec compared to the rest of Canada.},

This reversal shows that the total fertility rates of the most developed nations in the world are actually increasing. The trend means different things. In some cases, it is simply a data product of the slowing average age at ﬁrst birth for women in highly developed areas. For others, it is a cultural shift towards larger families in response to a surplus of economic resources. Using multiple data sources, this research examines this shift in the United States by examining levels of relative subnational human development at the county level and associated relationships to county total fertility rates. Results highlight a non-linear relationship that suggests sub-national human development is related to sub-national variations in fertility behaviors similar to recent research on a global scale. The policy implications of such a reversal in fertility are very important for government ofﬁcials and public policy makers as they move forward in addressing future issues associated with population aging, labor force turnover, and in the providing of services to youth.},

	abstract = {Occupations are central to the stratification systems of industrial countries, but they have played little role in empirical attempts to explain the well-documented increase in wage inequality that occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. We address this deficiency by assessing occupation-level effects on wage inequality using data from the Current Population Survey for 1983 through 2008. We model the mean and variance of wages for each occupation, controlling for education and demographic factors at the individual level to test three competing explanations for the increase in wage inequality: (1) the growth of between-occupation polarization, (2) changes in education and labor force composition, and (3) residual inequality unaccounted for by occupations and demographic characteristics. After correcting for a problem with imputed data that biased Kim and Sakamoto’s (2008) results, we find that betweenoccupation changes explain 66 percent of the increase in wage inequality from 1992 to 2008, although 23 percent of this is due to the switch to the 2000 occupation codes in 2003. Sensitivity analysis reveals that 18 percent of the increase in inequality from 1983 to 2002 is due to changes in just three occupations: managers ‘‘not elsewhere classified,’’ secretaries, and computer systems analysts.},

This question is key to the discussion whether or not governments should take action aimed at influencing the fertility rate. To enhance the scholarly discussion in this field, the paper introduces a clearly defined hypothesis which describes plausible self-reinforcing mechanisms that would result, if unchecked, in a continued decrease of the number of births in the countries affected. This hypothesis has three components: a demographic one based on the negative population growth momentum, i.e., the fact that fewer potential mothers in the future will result in fewer births; a sociological one based on the assumption that ideal family size for the younger cohorts is declining as a consequence of the lower actual fertility they see in previous cohorts; and an economic one based on the first part of Easterlin’s (1980) relative income hypothesis, namely, that fertility results from the combination of aspirations and expected income, and assuming that aspirations of young adults are on an increasing trajectory while the expected income for the younger cohorts declines, partly as a consequence of population ageing induced by low fertility. All three factors would work towards a downward spiral in births in the future. If there is reason to assume that such mechanisms will indeed be at work, then this should strengthen the motivation of governments to take immediate action (possibly through policies addressing the tempo effect) in order to still escape from the expected trap.},

We refute the statistical basis of fertility rising with improving human development ({HDI}) or any other such general composite index. Instead we show that the bottlenecks are much more specific and are due to particular mixes of factors in the various countries. We predict the continuation of structural below replacement fertility for the second decade of the 21st Century in Europe. German-speaking countries could escape from the low fertility trap if they adjust their child-care and school organization, but for southern and formerly Communist countries ({FCCs}), that escape will be more difficult given the existence of multiple disadvantages.},

Uncertain and unpredictable work contrasts with the relative security that characterized the three decades following World War {II}. Precarious work constitutes a global challenge that has a wide range of consequences cutting across many areas of concern to sociologists. Hence, it is increasingly important to understand the new workplace arrangements that generate precarious work and worker insecurity. A focus on employment relations forms the foundation of theories of the institutions and structures that generate precarious work and the cultural and individual factors that influence people's responses to uncertainty. Sociologists are well-positioned to explain, offer insight, and provide input into public policy about such changes and the state of contemporary employment relations.},

We characterize country-level support environments across a broader set of domains than is typical, including supports from institutions, labor markets, extended families, and male partners. With rare exceptions, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant relationships between family support environment indicators and second or higher order births. In contrast, the relationship between family support environment indicators and ﬁrst births is weaker and less often signiﬁcant. This pattern accords with theory that practical considerations are more important for the second and subsequent births than for the transition to parenthood. Although most forms of support are positively related to fertility, we document a negative relationship between intergenerational exchange of support and higher order fertility. Our analyses also reveal that macro-level support environments are related to childbearing plans in much the same way as they are related to having a child, buttressing the argument that understanding the determinants of childbearing plans can help us to understand childbearing behavior.},

            Trade union institutions are historically and comparatively weak in the United States, and union membership has been in steady decline over several decades. Scholars thus question the contemporary relevance of organized labor to social policy. Yet, there is considerable state-level variation in social policy and union institutional strength that remains underexamined. Focusing on variability across {US} states, this paper uses mixed-methods analysis to examine relationships between organized labor and parental and family leave legislation under varying political conditions. Event history analysis of state-level leave policy adoption from 1983 to 2016 shows that union institutional strength, particularly in the public sector, is positively associated with the timing of leave policy adoption. These findings are robust to the inclusion of other factors, including Democratic control of state houses, which is also shown to facilitate leave policy adoption. Comparative case studies support event history findings and illustrate how state house partisanship informs the level of government that leave advocates target for policy change. The paper concludes by suggesting further attention to subnational policies and investigation into the social movement practice of target-shifting and its effects. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the operation of power resources at the subnational level within a liberal market national context.},

Even though the overall pattern is repeated, there are large cross-country variations in the timing and speed of the demographic transition. What accounts for falling fertility during the transition to growth? To answer this question, this paper develops a uni®ed growth model that delivers a transition from stagnation to growth, accompanied by declining fertility. The model is used to determine whether government policies that affect the opportunity cost of education can account for crosscountry variations in fertility decline. Among the policies considered, education subsidies are found to have only minor effects, while accounting for child labor regulation is crucial. Apart from in¯uencing fertility, the policies also determine the evolution of the income distribution in the course of development.},

{OBJECTIVE} The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the fertility reaction to different indicators of the crisis. Beyond the structural labor market conditions, I investigate the dependence of fertility rates on economic policy uncertainty, government financial risk, and consumer confidence.
{METHODS} Following Goldstein et al. (2013), I use log-log models to assess the elasticity of age-, parity-, and education-specific fertility rates to an array of indicators. Besides the inclusion of a wider set of explanatory variables, I include more recent data (2000−2013) and I enlarge the sample to 31 European countries plus the United States.
{RESULTS} Fertility response to unemployment in some age- and parity-specific groups has been, in more recent years, larger than estimated by Goldstein et al. (2013). Female unemployment has also been significantly reducing fertility rates. Among uncertainty measures, the drop in consumer confidence is strongly related to fertility decline and in Southern European countries the fertility response to sovereign debt risk is comparable to that of unemployment. Economic policy uncertainty is negatively related to {TFR} even when controlling for unemployment.
{CONCLUSIONS} Theoretical and empirical investigation is needed to develop more tailored measures of economic and financial insecurity and their impact on birth rates.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, a decline in birth rates in advanced industrialized societies to levels well below those required for population replacement has been accompanied by a major change in the crossnational incidence of fertility. This has, in turn, given rise to a massive transformation in traditional cross-national patterns of relationships between fertility and other variables. Whereas previously the countries with the highest period fertility rates were those in which family-oriented cultural traditions were most pronounced and in which women’s labour market participation was least, these relationships are now wholly reversed. This study uses data for 21 {OECD} countries to provide a more thorough and systematic mapping of the linkages between fertility, cultural values, economic structure and social policy than has hitherto been attempted in the literature, while simultaneously addressing some of the theoretical and methodological issues that arise in explaining a reversal of this magnitude. It argues that seemingly anomalous linkages with cultural traditions and employment structure are consequences of women’s changing work and family preferences and of cross-national differences in the adoption of family-friendly public policy.},

We find little effect of job losses on the white teen birthrate. For black teens, however, job losses to 1 \% of the working-age population decrease the birthrate by around 2 \%. Birth declines start five months after the job loss and then last for more than one year. Linking the timing of job losses and conceptions suggests that black teen births decline because of increased terminations and perhaps also because of changes in prepregnancy behaviors. National data on risk behaviors also provide evidence that black teens reduce sexual activity and increase contraception use in response to job losses. Job losses seven to nine months after conception do not affect teen birthrates, indicating that teens do not anticipate job losses and lending confidence that job losses are “shocks” that can be viewed as quasi-experimental variation. We also find evidence that relatively advantaged black teens disproportionately abort after job losses, implying that the average child born to a black teen in the wake of job loss is relatively more disadvantaged.},

To do so, the differential effects of local and regional unemployment on the likelihood that individual women and men are unemployed and differences in the underlying patterns of unemployment by gender are explored. Using a unique tabulation of micro data for labor market areas, two series of multilevel models for women and men are fit. The multilevel model results suggest that regional variation in unemployment is more evident for men than for women and, contrary to the empirical evidence, the underlying pattern of unemployment for men is more clustered than for women. The article concludes by discussing the policy implications of the finding that most of the variation in labor market outcomes for both women and men is attributable to individual-level rather than labor market area-level characteristics.},

The {SDT} predicts unilinear change toward very low fertility and a diversity of union and family types. The primary driver of these changes is a powerful, inevitable, and irreversible shift in attitudes and norms in the direction of greater individual freedom and self-actualization. First, we describe the origin of this framework and its evolution over time. Second, we review the empirical ﬁt of the framework to major changes in demographic and family behavior in the United States, the West, and beyond. As has been the case for other unilinear, developmental theories of demographic or family change, the {SDT} failed to predict many contemporary patterns of change and difference. Finally, we review previous critiques and identify fundamental weaknesses of this perspective, and we provide brief comparisons to selected alternative approaches.},

	abstract = {During the last two decades, Sweden has experienced strong ﬂuctuations both in its economy and in its level of childbearing. A period of high employment and increasing fertility has been followed by a period of lower employment and decreasing fertility since the beginning of the 1990s. In this paper, we use register data for Swedish women in order to examine how various types of attachment to the labour market affect women’s propensity to give birth at different parities. Speciﬁcally, we show what impact changes in women’s employment status have had on recorded fertility trends in Sweden. We ﬁnd that women who have relatively low levels of income and women who are enrolled as students generally have lower fertility than other women. We also ﬁnd that a rise in the number of women with such characteristics can explain part of the decrease in fertility during the 1990s. It is evident, however, that other factors, working at the macro level, also have to be considered when one wants to explain the ﬂuctuating fertility of Sweden. Social policy is one such factor. In sum, we ﬁnd a pattern of pro-cyclical fertility, where levels of female earnings are positively related to levels of childbearing.},

The hypothesis is that characteristics of the job occupied at the beginning career lead to a differential transition to parenthood, characterized by a greater likelihood of having a first child for men whose job shows stability, compared with those whose first job is unstable and precarious. The data used are derived from the Statistics Canada 2001 General Social Survey, to which applied methods are used in event history analysis. The results validate the hypothesis, in indicating that full-time wage earners and self-employed workers have a greater likelihood of having a first child than part-time wage-earners. Results also show that the effect of characteristics of the job is limited in the first five years spent on the job. In addition, the job seems to accelerate the transition to parenthood for men married before being hired. All of the results suggest the need for family support to help young couples become established and for governments to adopt measures to encourage young people’s work integration.},

	abstract = {Fertility has unanimously declined across the entire post-communist region. This study explores the variation in fertility trends over time among these countries and assesses to what degree three explanations are applicable: second demographic transition ({SDT}), postponement transition ({PPT}) or reaction to the economic crisis. Moreover, on the basis of {SDT} and {PPT} theoretical tenets, as well as descriptive evidence, the economic context is hypothesized to be linked to two processes of fertility decline conversely. The results show that no one theoretical explanation is sufﬁcient to explain the complex fertility declines across the entire post-communist region from 1990 to 2003. In some countries, a great part of the decline in fertility occurred before signiﬁcant postponement of childbearing began, which indicates that the dramatic decline was due to stopping behavior or postponement of higher order births. Postponement of ﬁrst births, either through {PPT} or {SDT} processes, greatly contributed to fertility decline in a small number of countries. Pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses of age-speciﬁc birthrates conﬁrm that these two distinct processes are present and show that the economic crisis explanation has explanatory power for declining birth rates. In contrast, logistic regressions show that the likelihood of postponing childbirth increases with improved economic conditions. These results conﬁrm the importance of taking the economic context into account when discussing explanations for fertility decline. More speciﬁcally, the results indicate that the severity and duration of economic crisis, or absence thereof, inﬂuenced the extent and manner in which fertility declined.},

Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth outside of marriage. Recent theoretical and qualitative work at the intersection of demography and cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high, nearly unattainable, economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions. We use the events of the Great Recession, leveraging variation in the severity of the crisis between years and across states, to examine how exposure to worse state-level economic conditions is related to poor women’s likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012. In accord with theory, we find that women of low socioeconomic status ({SES}) exposed to worse economic conditions are indeed somewhat less likely to marry. However, we also find that unmarried low-{SES} women exposed to worse economic conditions significantly reduce their fertility; economic standing is not disconnected from nonmarital fertility. Our results suggest that economic concerns were connected to fertility decisions for low-{SES} unmarried women during the Great Recession.},

We use Cox regressions with data from the 1979 {US} National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Finnish Census Panel data to demonstrate both striking similarities and differences between the two countries. First, high-income women from disadvantaged backgrounds postpone entry into parenthood in both countries. Second, high parental resources are associated with postponed entry into parenthood among lowincome women. However, we find differences between the two countries regarding which parental resource is most influential.

	abstract = {The diversity of early family life courses is thought to have increased, although empirical evidence is mixed. Less standardized family formation is attributed to compositional changes in educational attainment, labour market participation, and childhood living conditions. I investigate whether and why family trajectories have become more or less standardized across birth cohorts in Sweden. I combine sequence metrics with Oaxaca–Blinder decompositions to assess the compositional shifts that drive changes in family formation standardization. Family trajectories of individuals born in 1952, 1962, and 1972 from age 18 to 35 are reconstructed using Swedish register data. My results demonstrate that early family formation has become more standardized across birth cohorts. Further, compositional differences between birth cohorts partially account for this standardization, especially for women. For example, higher levels of educational attainment are associated with family formation standardization. This substantiates arguments that family formation may re-standardize following the second demographic transition.},

While most existing studies investigate the consequences of the deterioration of employment conditions in ab­ solute terms, in this paper I test the hypothesis that relative changes in occupational conditions affect childbearing choices. In particular, building on the Easterlin Hypothesis of resources and aspirations I investigate how intergenerational mobility among American men and women during the Great Recession affected their chances of becoming parents. Using respondents’ labor market trajectories from the {PSID} 2003–2017 data, I show that when both men and women hold an occupational position as prestigious as that held by their parents when they were growing up, they are more likely to have a first child than when they hold a downward-mobile job. However, men and women differ in how this process is moderated by aggregate labor market conditions.},

Status enhancement aims seem the most plausible link between mobility and childbearing. The relationship appears moderated by the economic context, which we interpret as being related to diﬀerential selection into upward and downward mobility based on labor market opportunities. In general, the suppressing eﬀect of upward mobility on second birth risks was stronger in the poorer economic context of Russia, whereas the increased second birth risks related to downward mobility were heightened in Poland’s more prosperous context.},

In demographic research, standard analyses of the duration until an event occurs rely heavily on the appropriate use of covariates that change over time. We apply these best-practice methods to the study of social mobility and demographic outcomes in Sweden using register data that covers the years 1996–2012. The mortality analysis includes 1,024,142 women and 747,532 men and the fertility analysis includes 191,142 women and 164,368 men. We identify the challenges inherent in this combination and present strategies with an application to how social mobility is related to both fertility and mortality. Our application is successful at incorporating all requirements related to these methods. Our ﬁndings suggest, however, that certain data characteristics, such as a relatively high share of missing data, can be problematic. We also ﬁnd that controlling for origin and destination status generally provides acceptable estimates of the mobility association in the speciﬁc case of Sweden and the relationship between social mobility and both fertility and mortality.},

This focus potentially overemphasizes similarity and obscures heterogeneity in parental effects on family behavior. In this study, we make two contributions. First, instead of focusing on isolated focal events, we conceptualize parents’ and their children’s family formation holistically as the process of union formation and childbearing between ages 15 and 40. We then discuss mechanisms likely to shape these intergenerational patterns. Second, beyond estimating average transmission effects, we innovatively apply multichannel sequence analysis to dyadic sequence data on middleclass American families from the Longitudinal Study of Generations ({LSOG}; N = 461 parent-child dyads). The results show three salient intergenerational family formation patterns among this population: a strong transmission, a moderated transmission, and an intergenerational contrast pattern. We examine what determines parents’ and children’s likelihood to sort into a specific intergenerational pattern. For middle-class American families, educational upward mobility is a strong predictor of moderated intergenerational transmission, whereas close emotional bonds between parents and children foster strong intergenerational transmission. We conclude that intergenerational patterns of family formation are generated at the intersection of macro-structural change and family internal psychological dynamics.},

Because of the lack of systematic theory guiding the research, conceptualizations and measures of social mobility and fertility vary markedly from study to study, leading to inconsistent findings. Research also differs regarding what constitutes a "true" mobility effect, particularly whether one must distinguish the process of mobility from the additive effects of origin and destination variables used to define mobility. The review focuses on theoretical perspectives underpinning the research, causal operators proposed to interpret observed associations, and analytical methods used. We highlight the multifaceted, complex, and incompletely understood nature of the social mobility-fertility relationship and suggest some fruitful avenues future research might pursue.},

The explanatory model focuses, on the one hand, on Easterlin’s work on the conflicts between aspirations and resources and, on the other hand, on some key assumptions of theories of the inequality of educational opportunities (Boudon; Breen). One of the hypotheses implied by this explanatory model is that individuals will leave parental home not before they have achieved a socio-economic position at least similar to that of the their family of origins. This hypothesis has been tested by means of two analyses. First, I compare the youth socio-economic position with that of their parents and study the relationship between the aggregate rate of social mobility and the median age of emancipation by cohort. Second, by means of an event history analysis, I investigate how the experience of social mobility affects the likelihood of the transition to residential independence at the individual level.

Employment instab­ il­ity, which most often man­i­fests in unem­ploym­ ent or time-lim­ited employm­ ent, is usua­lly deemed to have a nega­­tive effect on fer­til­ity, although dif­fer­ent fer­til­ity reac­tions are hypoth­e­sized by socio­log­i­cal the­o­ries, and micro-level evi­dence is fragmented and con­tra­dic­tory. We used metaana­lytic tech­niques to syn­the­size Euro­pean research find­ings, offer gen­eral con­clu­sions about the effects of employm­ ent instab­ il­ity on fert­ili­ty (in terms of direct­ion and size), and rank dif­fer­ent sources of employm­ ent instab­ il­ity.

Next, the neg­a­tive effect of employm­ ent instability on fert­ili­ty has become stronger over time, and is more severe in Southern Europ­ ean countries, where social prot­ect­ion for fami­­lies and the unemp­ loyed is least gene­ r­ous. Finally, meta-regress­ ion esti­ma­tes demo­ n­strate that faili­ng to account for income and part­ner char­ac­ter­is­tics leads to an over­es­ti­mat­ion of the neg­a­tive effect of employ­ment instab­ il­ity on fert­ili­ty.

Though wages and participation have fallen in tandem for this population, we argue that the canonical neoclassical framework, which postulates a labor demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably explain the data. Alternatives we discuss include adjustment frictions associated with labor demand shocks and effects of the changing marriage market—that is, the fact that fewer less-educated men are forming their own stable families—on male labor supply incentives. In the synthesis that emerges, the phenomenon of declining prime-age male labor-force participation is not coherently explained by a series of causal factors acting separately. A more reasonable interpretation, we argue, involves complex feedbacks between labor demand, family structure, and other factors that have disproportionately affected less-educated men.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes and predicts the changes of relationship between income and fertility rate of cross-countries using a bivariate mixture model and a latent change score model. This paper has shown that there is a negative relationship between income and fertility rate, which is presented in the form of inverted S-shaped curve which shows the three regimes of demographic transition. Some developed countries have completed their demographic transition in fertility rate, and in developing countries, the demographic transition in fertility rate is still in progress. This paper has also shown that the number of peaks of income distribution has increased in recent years comparing to 1960s and the number won’t decrease in the future. However, the number of peaks of fertility rate distribution hasn’t changed from 1960s to recent years but due to the shift, finally, the distribution will change to a uni-modal distribution in the future. The income will be applied to the conditional convergence and the fertility rate will be applied to the absolute convergence. The fertility gap among cross-countries will disappear, but the income gap won’t. Although the population conditions in developing countries will improve, income inequality in cross-country may not be improved after all.},

He suggested that when incomes are higher than material aspirations (formed in childhood), birth rates would rise. This paper uses microeconomic data to formulate a measure of an individual's relative income. The use of microeconomic data allows the researcher to control for both state ﬁxed effects and cohort ﬁxed effects, both have been absent in previous examinations of Easterlin's hypothesis. The results of the empirical analysis are consistent with Easterlin's assertion that relative income inﬂuenced fertility decisions, although the effect operates only through childhood income. When the estimated effects are contextualized, they explain 12\% of the U.S. baby boom.},

The results suggest that accounting for spatial interdependencies is necessary to avoid model misspecifications.

	abstract = {In recent years, fertility rates have declined in most wealthy countries. This phenomenon has largely been explained by focusing on the rise of economic uncertainty. We contribute to this debate by arguing that, under uncertain conditions, narratives of the future—i.e., socially conveyed imagined futures—impact individuals’ decisionmaking about childbearing. To assess this impact, we conducted (for the first time in fertility intention research) a controlled laboratory experiment in two contrasting settings: Florence (Italy, N = 800) and Oslo (Norway, N = 874). Individuals were randomly exposed to a specific positive or negative future economic scenario (treatments) and were compared with individuals who were not exposed to any scenario (control group). Participants were then asked whether they intended to have a child in the next three years. The results showed a clear causal impact of narratives of the future on fertility intentions among the participants. Moreover, when the actual economic condition at the macro- (country context) or micro-level (labor-market status and characteristics) was more favorable, negative narratives of the future played a more crucial role. Conversely, when the actual economic conditions were less favorable, positive narratives of the future proved especially important. We conclude that, in the era of global uncertainty, individuals respond to more than their actual situation and constraints; narratives of the future create a distance experience from the daily routine that plays a potent role by inhibiting or facilitating fertility decision-making.},

            Little is known about the validity of group-level theories of ethnic intermarriage despite the fact that such theories are often invoked in explaining why certain ethnic groups are “closed,” whereas others are relatively “open.” We develop a comparative perspective by analyzing the marriage choices of 94 national-origin groups in the United States, using pooled data from the Current Population Surveys, 1994–2006, and multilevel models in which individual and contextual determinants of intermarriage are included simultaneously. Our analyses show large differences in endogamy across groups. After taking compositional effects into account, we find that both structural and cultural group-level factors have significant effects on endogamy. Cultural explanations (which focus on the role of norms and preferences) play a more important role than structural explanations (which focus on meeting and mating opportunities). Our results reinforce the common but untested interpretation of endogamy in terms of group boundaries.},

Just under one half of women who had experienced marital dissolution went on to experience a conception within twelve years. A women’s age and her repartnering status are shown to be the factors most strongly associated with the probability of a post-dissolution conception. The age of a woman’s youngest child is found to be more strongly associated with her likelihood of experiencing a conception than her parity at marital dissolution.},

Out-of-sample predictions of offline matches, i.e., marriages, exhibit assortative mating patterns similar to those observed in actual marriages. Thus, mate preferences, without resort to search frictions, can generate sorting in marriages.

	abstract = {A Search Model of Marriage with Differential Fecundity∗ It is commonly observed that over time and across societies, women tend to marry older men. The traditional explanation for this phenomenon is that wages increase with age and hence older men are more attractive in the marriage market. This explanation, however, involves an implicit assumption about female specialization in home production - an assumption that does not completely hold, especially in modern times.},

	abstract = {Preferences for certain age characteristics of partners are reported across cultures: men prefer mates who are younger and women prefer mates older than themselves. To examine whether these age preferences entail fitness effects for men and women, we investigated the association among age differences between partners and offspring count. On the basis of a sample of approximately 10 000 post-reproductive Swedish men and women who did not change their partner between the birth of their first and last child, we find maximum offspring count in men if their partner is approximately 6 years younger, and in women if their partner is approximately 4 years older. We further find that after separation, on average, both men and women shift to a partner younger than the first, albeit in women the new partner is still older than the female herself. We conclude that the age preference for the partner yields fitness benefits for both men and women and may thus be an evolutionarily acquired trait.},

We look at the influence of urbanisation, education, percentage population of Muslim faith, and family type. We find that education is key in determining at what age women marry, having as would be expected a positive effect on age at first marriage and depressing spousal age gap. Urbanisation is significant, with a positive effect on age and negative on spousal age gap, although the effect is not very large. The percentage Muslim variable depresses female age at first marriage and increases spousal age gap but only when family type is not controlled for. The initially strong negative effect of percentage population Muslim over the period under consideration on age of first marriage has decreased, which raises some interesting questions about the role of Islam in female empowerment.},

However, these macro studies have provided quite ambiguous ﬁndings and interpretations. In comparison, the life course approach analyzes single individuals over the life course and explicitly recognizes the dynamic nature of partner decisions and the importance of educational roles and institutional circumstances. Based on life course studies, educational homogamy seems to be driven by three factors: (a) Individuals often prefer to associate with equally educated partners; (b) educational expansion increases contact opportunities for equally educated men and women at an age when young people start to look for partners and form couples; and (c) women’s changing economic role in dual-earner societies increases the importance of women’s education and labor force attachment.},

To explain this social stratiﬁcation, we outline a theoretical framework in which social stratiﬁcation affects choice in the transition to adulthood through three, potentially reinforcing, pathways: stratiﬁed socialization, stratiﬁed agency, and stratiﬁed opportunity. We test our framework against longitudinal data from two waves of the Generations and Gender Surveys for Austria, Bulgaria, and France. We ﬁnd evidence for the importance of all three pathways. Furthermore, processes differ little by gender, age and country context.},

In the model, women are valued more for their ability to bear children and men are valued more for their ability to make money. Men cannot reveal their labor market ability to potential spouses until they enter the labor force. At the same time, the relevant information for evaluating females as spouses is revealed at a younger age. The model predicts that the income of males will be positively associated with age-at-first-marriage. We find empirical support for the model. However, we also find the association between male earnings and age-at-first-marriage becomes negative for those who married after age 30, which was not predicted by the model. Consistent with the model, we do not find a strong relationship between earnings and age-at-first-marriage among females.},

	shorttitle = {Measuring Unmet Need},
	abstract = {Methods: Data from recent Demographic and Health Surveys ({DHS}) in Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic and Zambia are used to examine a new deﬁnition of unmet need—one that considers only responses regarding prospective fertility desires and intentions to use contraceptives. Unmet need is determined for wives, for husbands and for couples. A minimum estimate of unmet need for couples is produced when both partners have unmet need; a maximum occurs if either spouse having unmet need deﬁnes couple unmet need.
Results: Differences between spouses in contraceptive and fertility intentions are substantial in all three countries. There is greater dissimilarity between husbands and wives regarding intention to practice contraception than there is regarding childbearing intentions. In Zambia, 55\% of wives who were not practicing contraception report intending to use contraceptives within 12 months, compared with 36\% of comparable husbands. In Bangladesh, the corresponding ﬁgures are 46\% for wives and 42\% for husbands; in the Dominican Republic, the proportions are 49\% and 41\%, respectively. When unmet need calculated using wives’ reports is compared with results using the minimum estimate, couples’ unmet need is overestimated by 106\% in Bangladesh, by 96\% in the Dominican Republic and by 246\% in Zambia. On the other hand, estimates based on wives’ reports were closer to the maximum estimate for couples.
Conclusions: Unmet need calculated for married women differs considerably from unmet need calculated for husbands and couples. Large discrepancies in these measures may be an indicator of spousal disagreement or lack of communication about reproductive goals or contraceptive use—issues that programs will have to address if they seek to raise contraceptive prevalence rates.

Yet there has been little focus on this aspect of family behaviour for immigrants and their descendants. We argue that this is an important omission, not least because the mean age gaps across generations can be interpreted as a macro-level indicator of adaptation. Our study examines the age gaps of immigrants and their descendants in Sweden, a country with high gender equality and a stable mean age gap. Since the late 1960s, Swedish men have been around 2 years older, on average, than their female partners. Using longitudinal data for the whole population of Sweden, we examine changes in age gaps for cohorts born 1950-1986. We show that cohort trends in age gaps often follow very different patterns for male and female immigrant groups, with limited evidence of adaptation across cohorts. However, there is considerable evidence of adaptation toward the Swedish norm for the second generation, including when making a direct comparison between immigrants and their children, although more so for male immigrants, in part due to patterns of partnership with the Swedish-born.},

            In this article a diagonal mobility model is used to describe the relative effects of husbands’ and wives’ characteristics on fertility. Compared with the characteristics of their wives, the characteristics of non-Hispanic husbands are nearly insignificant in their effect on fertility. The relative importance of husbands’ attributes is much greater among Mexican-American couples. Although this suggests ethnic stereotypes about male dominance in Mexican-American families, differences in female educational attainment may offer a better explanation. The most immediate conclusion from this analysis pertains to the use of wives’ characteristics as a proxy for couple data. This strategy is reasonable if female educational levels generally extend into high school. Relying on wives’ characteristics to study marital fertility, however, may be problematic if the analysis involves respondents with a wide range of educational levels.},

	abstract = {We study the relationship between personality traits and fertility using a survey of Norwegian men and women born from 1927 to 1968 (N = 7017 individuals). We found that personality relates to men's and women's fertility differently; conscientiousness decreases female fertility, openness decreases male fertility and extraversion raises the fertility of both sexes. Neuroticism depresses fertility for men, but only for those born after 1956. The lower male fertility in younger cohorts high in neuroticism cannot be explained by partnership status, income or education. The proportion of childless men (at age 40 years) has increased rapidly for Norwegian male cohorts from 1940 to 1970 (from about 15 to 25 per cent). For women, it has only increased marginally (from 10 to 13 per cent). Our findings suggest that this could be partly explained by the increasing importance of personality characteristics for men's probability of becoming fathers. Men that have certain personality traits may increasingly be avoiding the long–term commitment of having children, or their female partners are shunning entering this type of commitment with them. Childbearing in contemporary richer countries may be less likely to be influenced by economic necessities and more by individual partner characteristics, such as personality.

The paper analyzes how male and female age preferences can be explained by an individual’s own age, preferences for other traits, and own market-relevant traits that are favorable or unfavorable for others. Our results show that age preferences essentially shift with age, but in different ways for men and women: Whereas men increasingly prefer younger women as they age, women’s age preferences become increasingly diverse. They also show that age preferences are confounded with gender-specific preferences for attractiveness and education. Finally, preferences for age also vary with marketrelevant traits such as education and parenthood, but not with prior marital experience. Altogether, our analyses point to a gender-specific decline in mate value with differential consequences for men’s and women’s mating preferences.},

Second, we examine to what extend the most frequently studied determinants of divorce and separation depend on partner market opportunities. Our results show that the number of opposite sex contacts increases the probability of separation. Sharing the same contacts with one’s partner decreases the risk of separation. Our results indicate further that reducing opposite sex contacts in the course of the relationship is partly responsible for the higher stability of longer-lasting relationships. Having a migration background is associated with fewer opposite sex contacts. This means that having a migration background would be more destabilising if these individuals did not have less opposite sex contacts than individuals without a migration background. In contrast, joint home ownership, church attendance, higher education and residing in western Germany would generally be more stabilising if these factors were not connected with more opposite sex contacts.},

We provide a unique test of contact, conﬂict, and ingroup identiﬁcation theories. We show that individuals uniformly prefer to date same-race partners and that there is a hierarchy of preferences both among natives and minority groups. Notable country differences are also found. Europeans living in countries with a large foreign-born population have an increased preference for minority groups. The ethnically heterogeneous Swiss population displays the strongest preference for minorities, with the more homogenous Poland, Spain, and Italy, the least. Anti-immigrant attitudes are related to stronger in-group preferences among natives. Unexpectedly, non-Arabic minority daters belonging to large-size communities have strong preferences for Europeans. The results have implications for immigrant integration policies and demonstrate that Internet dating allows efﬁcient selection by racial divisions, perpetuating country-speciﬁc racial inequalities.},

            Based on data from 1979–1990 {NLSY} interviews, we investigate the implications of rising economic inequality for young men’s marriage timing. Our approach is to relate marriage formation to the ease or difficulty of the career-entry process and to show that large race/schooling differences in career development lead to substantial variations in marriage timing. We develop measures of current career “maturity” and of long-term labor-market position. Employing discrete-time event-history methods, we show that these variables have a substantial impact on marriage formation for both blacks and whites. Applying our regression results to models based on observed race/schooling patterns of career development, we then estimate cumulative proportions ever married in a difficult versus an easy career-entry process. We find major differences in the pace of marriage formation, depending on the difficulty of the career transition. We also find considerable differences in these marriage timing patterns across race/schooling groups corresponding to the large observed differences in the speed and difficulty of career transitions between and within these groups},

	abstract = {Applications of optimal matching analysis in the social sciences are typically based on sequences of specific social statuses that model the residential, family, or occupational trajectories of individuals. Despite the broadly recognized interdependence of these statuses, few attempts have been made to systematize the ways in which optimal matching analysis should be applied multidimensionally—that is, in an approach that takes into account multiple trajectories simultaneously. Based on methods pioneered in the field of bioinformatics, this paper proposes a method of multichannel sequence analysis ({MCSA}) that simultaneously extends the usual optimal matching analysis ({OMA}) to multiple life spheres. Using data from the Swiss household panel ({SHP}), we examine the types of trajectories obtained using {MCSA}. We also consider a random data set and find that {MCSA} offers an alternative to the sole use of ex-post sum of distance matrices by locally aligning distinct life trajectories simultaneously. Moreover, {MCSA} reduces the complexity of the typologies it allows to produce, without making them less informative. It is more robust to noise in the data, and it provides more reliable alignments than two independent {OMA}.},

	abstract = {Fixed effects ({FE}) panel models have been used extensively in the past, as those models control for all stable heterogeneity between units. Still, the conventional {FE} estimator relies on the assumption of parallel trends between treated and untreated groups. It returns biased results in the presence of heterogeneous slopes or growth curves that are related to the parameter of interest (e.g., selection into treatment is based on individual growth of the outcome). In this study, we derive the bias in conventional {FE} models and show that fixed effects individual slope ({FEIS}) models can overcome this problem. This is a more general version of the conventional {FE} model, which accounts for heterogeneous slopes or trends, thereby providing a powerful tool for panel data and other multilevel data in general. We propose two versions of the Hausman test that can be used to identify misspecification in {FE} models. The performance of the {FEIS} estimator and the specification tests is evaluated in a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Using the examples of the marital wage premium and returns to preschool education (Head Start), we demonstrate how taking heterogeneous effects into account can seriously change the conclusions drawn from conventional {FE} models. Thus, we propose to test for bias in {FE} models in practical applications and to apply {FEIS} if indicated by the specification tests.},

Such bounds are related to bounds on average annual fertility up to year t rather than to individual year bounds in time series forecasts, and so the autocorrelation of time series forecast errors is important in practical applications, This paper develops methods for using time series methods to make constrained long term forecasts of fertility. {SpecificaIly}, age-time variations in fertility are modeled with a single time-varying parameter, or fertility index; upper and lower bounds on the total fertility rate are imposed by forecasting an inverse logistic transform of the fertility index; the long run level of the fertility forecast is also constrained to equal a prespecified level. The principal interest is in the variance and the autocorrelation structure of the forecast errors. Based on these for the {USA} we conclude: (1) the probability interval for average fertility up to time t begins to contract after about 50 years, but only very slightly: (2) the probability interval for average fertility up to year 2065 is about three-fifths as wide as that for single year fertility in 2045, but is still far wider than the band for official forecasts; (3) realizations of the simple {ARMA} (1,\&l) forecast model exhibit long fluctuations something like actual fertility in industrial nations; (4) the model of fertility age patterns fits poorly at older ages, but may be adequate for present purposes.},

Many applied researchers use the {FE} estimator to adjust for unobserved unit-specific and time-specific confounders at the same time. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that the ability of the {FE} model to simultaneously adjust for these two types of unobserved confounders critically relies upon the assumption of linear additive eﬀects. Another common justification for the use of the {FE} estimator is based on its equivalence to the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimator under the simplest setting with two groups and two time periods. We show that this equivalence does not hold under more general settings commonly encountered in applied research. Instead, we prove that the multi-period diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimator is equivalent to the weighted {FE} estimator with some observations having negative weights. These analytical results imply that in contrast to the popular belief, the {FE} estimator does not represent a designbased, nonparametric estimation strategy for causal inference. Instead, its validity fundamentally rests on the modeling assumptions.},

Whereas several methods have been developed in economics, sociology, demography, and epidemiology to answer these types of questions, a recent method introduced by Jackson and {VanderWeele} (2018) provided an update to decompositions by anchoring them within causal inference theory. In this paper, we demonstrate how to implement the causal decomposition using Monte Carlo integration and the parametric g-formula. Causal decomposition can help to identify the sources of differences across populations and provide researchers with a way to move beyond estimating inequalities to explaining them and determining what can be done to reduce health disparities. Our implementation approach can easily and ﬂexibly be applied for different types of outcome and explanatory variables without having to derive decomposition equations. We describe the concepts of the approach and the practical steps and considerations needed to implement it. We then walk through a worked example in which we investigate the contribution of smoking to sex differences in mortality in South Korea. For this example, we provide both pseudocode and R code using our package, cfdecomp. Ultimately, we outline how to implement a very general decomposition algorithm that is grounded in counterfactual theory but still easy to apply to a wide range of situations.},

While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

	abstract = {Objective: Although recent statistical and computational developments allow for the empirical testing of psychological theories in ways not previously possible, one particularly vexing challenge remains: how to optimally model the prospective, reciprocal relations between 2 constructs as they developmentally unfold over time. Several analytic methods currently exist that attempt to model these types of relations, and each approach is successful to varying degrees. However, none provide the unambiguous separation over time of between-person and within-person components of stability and change, components that are often hypothesized to exist in the psychological sciences. Our goal in this article is to propose and demonstrate a novel extension of the multivariate latent curve model to allow for the disaggregation of these effects. Method: We begin with a review of the standard latent curve models and describe how these primarily capture between-person differences in change. We then extend this model to allow for regression structures among the time-specific residuals to capture within-person differences in change. Results: We demonstrate this model using an artificial data set generated to mimic the developmental relation between alcohol use and depressive symptomatology spanning 5 repeated measures. Conclusions: We obtain a specificity of results from the proposed analytic strategy that is not available from other existing methodologies. We conclude with potential limitations of our approach and directions for future research.},

The ÿrst is the {LM} tests for the spatial error correlation model discussed in Anselin (Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Rao’s score test in spatial econometrics, J. Statist. Plann. Inference 97 (2001) 113) and Anselin et al. (Regional Sci.

Econometrics 54 (1992) 95). The idea is to allow for both spatial error correlation as well as random region e ects in the panel data regression model and to test for their joint signiÿcance. Additionally, this paper derives conditional {LM} tests, which test for random regional e ects given the presence of spatial error correlation. Also, spatial error correlation given the presence of random regional e ects. These conditional {LM} tests are an alternative to the one-directional {LM} tests that test for random regional e ects ignoring the presence of spatial error correlation or the one-directional {LM} tests for spatial error correlation ignoring the presence of random regional e ects. We argue that these joint and conditional {LM} tests guard against possible misspeciÿcation. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments are conducted to study the performance of these {LM} tests as well as the corresponding likelihood ratio tests.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} A theoretical approach to explaining fertility behavior in developed countries needs an integrative perspective. As fertility behavior takes place in a multi-level setting of biological, psychological, social, economic, cultural, and political conditions, theories to explain fertility behavior need to be drawn from several academic disciplines and to address different levels of analysis.
{OBJECTIVE} With this Special Collection ({SC}) we contribute to the discussion by giving an update on current theoretical thinking about fertility. In our introduction, we elucidate some of the challenges of explaining fertility and fertility change from an integrated, interdisciplinary perspective, and address problems of theory construction. We address possible points of departure for tackling these challenges. We then introduce the articles gathered in the {SC}.
{CONCLUSIONS} Demographers have already presented some promising attempts at a more comprehensive model of fertility behavior and fertility trends. However, further joint efforts by scholars of the disciplines involved, both theoretically and empirically, are needed. One should continue a discussion promoting an integrated system of concepts and an exchange between the disciplines on key research questions.},

I find that 400,000 excess White deaths would be needed to equal the best mortality ever recorded among Blacks. For White mortality in 2020 to reach levels that Blacks experience outside of pandemics, current {COVID}-19 mortality levels would need to increase by a factor of nearly 6. Moreover, White life expectancy in 2020 will remain higher than Black life expectancy has ever been unless nearly 700,000 excess White deaths occur. Even amid {COVID}-19, {US} White mortality is likely to be less than what {US} Blacks have experienced every year. I argue that, if Black disadvantage operates every year on the scale of Whites’ experience of {COVID}-19, then so too should the tools we deploy to fight it.

We show this to be mistaken. The age patterns of {COVID}-19 mortality are such that vaccinating the oldest first saves the most lives and, surprisingly, also maximizes years of remaining life expectancy. We demonstrate this relationship empirically in the United States, Germany, and South Korea and with mathematical analysis of life tables.

Mortality per person would be less than that of the Spanish flu, but closer to that of the opioid and {HIV}/{AIDS} epidemics, while far more concentrated in time. The standard valuation of averting 1.75 million deaths would be many trillions of dollars.
          , 
            To put estimates of {COVID}-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes 1 million {US} lives, with results approximately scalable over a broad range of deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 2.94 y) and remaining life years (11.7 y per death). Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 trillion person years of life lost would be valued at \$10.2 to \$17.5 trillion. The age patterns of {COVID}-19 mortality in other countries are quite similar and increase at rates close to each country’s rate for all-cause mortality. The scenario of 1 million {COVID}-19 deaths is similar in scale to that of the decades-long {HIV}/{AIDS} and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than that of the Spanish flu of 1918. Unlike {HIV}/{AIDS} and opioid epidemics, the {COVID}-19 deaths are concentrated in a period of months rather than spread out over decades.},

While several studies have examined adult sex ratio effects in a multilevel perspective, many studies have focused on effects at an aggregated level only. In this paper, we review some key issues relating to such analyses. We address not only nation-level analyses, but also aggregation at lower levels, to investigate whether these issues extend to lower levels of aggregation. We illustrate these issues with novel databases covering a broad range of variables. Specifically, we discuss distributional issues with aggregated measures of adult sex ratio, significance testing, and statistical non-independence when using aggregate data. Firstly, we show that there are severe distributional issues with national adult sex ratio, such as extreme cases. Secondly, we demonstrate that many ‘meaningless’ variables are significantly correlated with adult sex ratio (e.g. the max. elevation level correlates with sex ratio at {US} state level). Finally, we re-examine associations between adult sex ratios and teenage fertility and find no robust evidence for an association at the aggregate level. Our review highlights the potential issues of using aggregate data on adult sex ratios to test hypotheses from an evolutionary perspective in humans.

            Because sex ratios are a key factor regulating mating success and subsequent fitness both across and within species, there is widespread interest in how population-wide sex ratio imbalances affect marriage markets and the formation of families in human societies. Although most modern cities have more women than men and suffer from low fertility rates, the effects of female-biased sex ratios have garnered less attention than male-biased ratios. Here, we analyze how sex ratios are linked to marriages, reproductive histories, dispersal, and urbanization by taking advantage of a natural experiment in which an entire population was forcibly displaced during World War {II} to other local Finnish populations of varying sizes and sex ratios. Using a discrete time-event generalized linear mixed-effects model, and including factors that change across time, such as annual sex ratio, we show how sex ratios, reproduction, and migration are connected in a female-dominated environment. Young childless women migrated toward urban centers where work was available to women, and away from male-biased rural areas. In such areas where there were more females, women were less likely to start reproduction. Despite this constraint, women showed little flexibility in mate choice, with no evidence for an increase in partner age difference in female-biased areas. We propose that together these behaviors and conditions combine to generate an “urban fertility trap” which may have important consequences for our understanding of the fertility dynamics of today including the current fertility decline across the developed world.},

Few studies have explored to what extent these dimensions of homogamy overlap. To ﬁll these gaps in our knowledge, this study examines homogamy in educational level and parental occupational class in Finland. The study uses excellent register data, which includes not only marriages but also nonmarital cohabiting unions. Log-linear models are applied to analyse homogamy in the unions of 30-year-old women (n ¼ 15,066). The results show that educational homogamy is overall stronger than homogamy in parental occupational class, and people with a higher university degree display the highest rates of homogamy. In the case of socio-economic origins, those from upper-white-collar and farmer families are particularly inclined towards in-group partner choice. Homogamy is not pervasive across all status groups: people from lower-white-collar families displayed no tendency towards homogamy, and the tendency was weak among those with an upper-secondary-level education. Also importantly, multivariate analyses show that educational homogamy and homogamy in parental social class are largely independent of one another. The latter two ﬁndings likely reﬂect the relatively egalitarian context of a Nordic welfare state.},

We tested the hypothesis that demographic shortages of suitable marital partners not only lower the probability of marriage, but increase the likelihood that never-married women will either: (a) marry men with characteristics dissimilar to their own or (b) marry men with low socioeconomic status. This analysis was accomplished using data from the 1979-1986 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, merged with various local-area sex ratios from the 1980 decennial U.S. Census. We found that a favorable marriage market, measured in terms of the relative number of men to women, increases the odds of marrying a high-status man compared with a low-status man (as measured in terms of education and occupation). It also increases the chance of forgoing marriage rather than marrying low-status men. At the same time, we found little evidence that mate surpluses or deficits in the local marriage market affect patterns of homogamy or assortative mating. The implication is that market conditions— good or bad—have little to do with women's willingness to marry heterogamously. Women are unwilling to “cast a wider net” in the face of market constraints.},

Our study population consists of all couples who had a first child and their parents, in every year between 1980 and 2007. Tertiary education is typically associated with decreased intergenerational proximity. We examine how increased enrolment has influenced distance to parents by using administrative register data for the complete population of Sweden. We perform a decomposition analysis, examining how the big expansion of tertiary education in Sweden during our study period has influenced intergenerational proximity. An explicit policy goal of this expansion was to widen the geographical access to tertiary education, and the government increased enrolment at newer regional institutions during this period. We additionally explore if the expansion of these newer tertiary institutions influenced average distance to parents. We find that intergenerational distances increased over the study period, and that this mainly was attributed to the increased enrolment at older tertiary universities. The expansion of regional tertiary institutions throughout Sweden had a small negative effect on intergenerational distance.},

In future cohorts, the authors expect to see (a) clearer contrasts between childless men and fathers, given indications that men are being more strongly selected into parenthood; (b) diminished differences between childless women and mothers, given the improved conditions for combining work and care; (c) fewer differences in reliance on formal support between older people with and without children, given the increased levels of education and material resources; and (d) that involuntary childlessness will be all the more distressing, given that a chosen life path has been blocked.},

Network members may then influence the agents’ transition to higher parity levels. Our numerical simulations indicate that accounting for social interactions can explain the shift of first-birth probabilities in Austria during the period 1984 to 2004. Moreover, we apply our model to forecast age-specific fertility rates up to 2016.},

	abstract = {While in the past men received more education than women, the gender gap in education has turned around: in recent years, more highly educated women than highly educated men are reaching the reproductive ages. Using data from the European Social Survey (rounds 1–6), we investigate the implications of this reversed gender gap for educational assortative mating. We ﬁt multilevel multinomial regression models to predict the proportions of men and women living with a partner of a given level of education, contingent on respondents’ own educational attainment and on the cohort-speciﬁc sex ratio among the population with tertiary education at the country level. We ﬁnd that highly educated women tend to partner more often ‘‘downwards’’ with less educated men, rather than remaining single more often. Medium educated women are found to partner less often ‘‘upwards’’ with highly educated men. For men, there is no evidence that they are more likely to partner with highly educated women. Rather, they are found to be living single more often. In sum, women’s advantage in higher education has affected mating patterns in important ways: while women previously tended to form unions with men who were at least as highly educated as themselves, they now tend to live with men who are at most as highly educated. Along the way, advanced education became a bonus on the mating market for women as well as for men.},

	abstract = {Social learning and life history interact in human adaptation, but nearly all models of the evolution of social learning omit age structure and population regulation. Further progress is hindered by a poor appreciation of how life history affects selection on learning. We discuss why life history and age structure are important for social learning and present an exemplary model of the evolution of social learning in which demographic properties of the population arise endogenously from assumptions about
              per capita
              vital rates and different forms of population regulation. We find that, counterintuitively, a stronger reliance on social learning is favoured in organisms characterized by ‘fast’ life histories with high mortality and fertility rates compared to ‘slower’ life histories typical of primates. Long lifespans make early investment in learning more profitable and increase the probability that the environment switches within generations. Both effects favour more individual learning. Additionally, under fertility regulation (as opposed to mortality regulation), more juveniles are born shortly after switches in the environment when many adults are not adapted, creating selection for more individual learning. To explain the empirical association between social learning and long life spans and to appreciate the implications for human evolution, we need further modelling frameworks allowing strategic learning and cumulative culture.

The model is a continuous-time matrix model that explicitly includes the processes of mating (which is nonlinear but homogeneous), ofspring production, and demographic transitions and survival. The resulting nonlinear model converges to exponential growth with an equilibrium population composition. The model can incorporate age- or stage-structured life histories and lexible mating functions. As an example, we apply the model to analyze the efects of mating strategies (polygamy or monogamy, and mated unions composed of males and females, of variable duration) on the response to sex-biased harvesting. The combination of demographic complexity with the interaction of the sexes can have major population dynamic efects and can change the outcome of evolution on sexrelated characters.},

The ﬁndings support the theoretical prediction. Kibbutz-leavers are more skilled than both stayers and other rural migrants and they earn higher wages upon exit than observably similar city natives and other migrants. In contrast, individuals who earn lower wages in the city are more likely to enter a kibbutz, but they are not more likely to move to other rural areas. These ﬁndings also support Borjas' hypothesis that migrants' self-selection depends on the difference in returns to skills between the origin and the destination.},

When partners are abundant, opportunities for mate switching may increase and relationship stability decrease. To date, most of the human literature has used regional areas at various levels of aggregation to define partner markets. But, in developed countries, many individuals of reproductive age spend a considerable amount of time outside their residential areas, and other measures may better capture the opportunities to meet a (new) partner. Here, we use Danish register data to test whether the sex ratio of the occupational sector is linked to divorce. Our data cover individuals in Denmark who married during 1981–2002 and we control for age at and duration of marriage, education and parity. Results support the prediction that a higher proportion of opposite-sex individuals in one's occupational sector is associated with higher divorce risk. This holds for both men and women, but associations are somewhat stronger for men and vary by education. Our results highlight the need to study demographic behaviours of men and women simultaneously, and to consider partner markets beyond geographical areas so that differing strategies for males and females may be examined.},

	abstract = {Evidence from animal species indicates that a male-biased adult sex ratio ({ASR}) can lead to higher levels of male parental investment and that there is heterogeneity in behavioural responses to mate scarcity depending on mate value. In humans, however, there is little consistent evidence of the effect of the {ASR} on pair-bond stability and parental investment and even less of how it varies by an individual's mate value. In this paper we use detailed census data from Northern Ireland to test the association between the {ASR} and pair-bond stability and parental investment by social status (education and social class) as a proxy for mate value. We find evidence that female, but not male, cohabitation is associated with the {ASR}. In female-biased areas women with low education are less likely to be in a stable pair-bond than highly educated women, but in male-biased areas women with the lowest education are as likely to be in a stable pair-bond as their most highly educated peers. For both sexes risk of separation is greater at female-biased sex ratios. Lastly, our data show a weak relationship between parental investment and the {ASR} that depends on social class. We discuss these results in the light of recent reformulations of parental investment theory.

Our measures remove the former distortion and provide means to assess the latter aging effect. The measures therefore provide a uniﬁed toolkit of fertility indices that (a) facilitate the description and analysis of past period fertility trends in terms of synthetic cohort measures, and (b) allow the projection of the timing, level and distribution of cohort fertility conditional on a speciﬁc postponement scenario. Due to their explicit relation to cohort behavior, these measures extend and improve the existing adjustment of the total fertility rate. We apply these methods to Sweden from 1970 to 1999.},

Accounts are given of recent research, relevant to prediction, in the mathematical description of mortality, nuptiality and fertility by age and duration variables. A systematic scheme for applying time relational models in this way is developed. The place of cohort methods is examined and it is concluded that their standard use for extrapolation of the level of fertility into the future is not justified in conditions similar to those in England and Wales.

Data were used from the 153 districts that showed improvement in their child sex ratio between 2001 and 2011. The improvement was decomposed into: (1) less sex-selective abortion and (2) improved girl compared with boy mortality. Most of the improvement in child sex ratios were shown to be due to reductions in sex-selective abortion, although this still made up the majority of the cause of imbalanced sex ratios in 2011. Child sex ratio improvement has been happening in both rural and urban areas of India, and there is evidence of stagnation in mortality decline for urban girls.},

	abstract = {The "two-sex problem" is one of attempting to preserve the essential character of male and female rates of marriage (or birth), since the expression of those rates is influenced both by the age-sex composition of the population and the underlying age-sex schedule of preferences. The present paper focuses on marriage and advances a theoretically based, realistic, and conceptually simple solution. In the continuous case, where exact male and female ages are used, equation (11) provides a mathematical relationship which equates the sum of the male and female marriage propensities of the observed population with that of the model. When discrete age intervals are used, the two-sex consistency condition is given by equation (14) which equates observed and model population rates calculated using the harmonic means of the number of persons in the relevant male and female age groups. The harmonic mean consistency condition is shown to be fully sensitive to the competitive nature of the "marriage market." When compared with alternative approaches to the two-sex problem in the context of data for Sweden, 1961-64, the simple harmonic mean method yields results fairly similar to those of the other methods. None of the two-sex methods do particularly well at predicting the actual distribution of marriages, however. The likely reason is that the underlying marriage preferences changed, a circumstance which emphasizes the importance of carefully conceptualizing how observed behavior can be decomposed into the effects produced by age-sex composition and those produced by the underlying preferences.},

A "rectangular" population, with equal numbers of persons in each age-sex group, is introduced as a standard, and a standardization relationship expressed in equation (9) relates changes in rectangular population rates to changes in age-sex composition. The standardization relationship is shown to satisfy a number of desirable properties and produce a realistic two-sex model. The standardization approach is then applied to data from Sweden for 1973, and the results and their implications are discussed. In particular, it is seen that the total number of marriages in a two-sex population neither is nor should be bounded by the total numbers of marriages in the associated male and female one-sex nuptiality-mortality tables.},

The penalized spline (P-spline) approach is particularly useful for these purposes, but it in small samples it can often produce implausible age schedule estimates.
{OBJECTIVE} I propose and evaluate a new type of P-spline model for estimating demographic rate schedules. These estimators, which I call D-splines, regularize and smooth highdimensional splines by using demographic patterns rather than generic mathematical rules.
{METHODS} I compare P-spline estimates of age-speciﬁc mortality rates to three alternative D-spline estimators, over a large number of simulated small populations with known rates. The penalties for the D-spline estimators are derived from patterns in the Human Mortality Database.
{RESULTS} For mortality estimates in small populations, D-spline estimators generally have lower errors than standard P-splines.
{CONCLUSIONS} Using penalties based on demographic information about patterns and variability in rate schedules improves P-spline estimators for small populations. {CONTRIBUTION} This paper expands demographers’ toolkit by developing a new category of P-spline estimators that are more reliable for estimating mortality in small populations.},

The algorithm estimates the effects of replacement for each elementary cell of one matrix by respective cell of another matrix. Application of the algorithm easily leads to the known formula for the age-decomposition of differences between two life expectancies. It also allows to develop new formulae for differences between healthy life expectancies. In the latter case, each age-component is split further into effects of mortality and effects of health. The application of the algorithm enables a numerical decomposition of the differences between total fertility rates and between parity progression ratios by age of the mother and parity. Empirical examples are based on mortality data from the {USA}, the {UK}, West Germany, and Poland and on fertility data from Russia.},

            Rectangularization of human survival curves is associated with decreasing variability in the distribution of ages at death. This variability, as measured by the interquartile range of life table ages at death, has decreased from about 65 years to 15 years since 1751 in Sweden. Most of this decline occurred between the 1870s and the 1950s. Since then, variability in age at death has been nearly constant in Sweden, Japan, and the United States, defying predictions of a continuing rectangularization. The United States is characterized by a relatively high degree of variability, compared with both Sweden and Japan. We suggest that the historical compression of mortality may have had significant psychological and behavioral impacts.},

            A demographic measure is often expressed as a deterministic or stochastic function of multiple variables (covariates), and a general problem (the decomposition problem) is to assess contributions of individual covariates to a difference in the demographic measure (dependent variable) between two populations. We propose a method of decomposition analysis based on an assumption that covariates change continuously along an actual or hypothetical dimension. This assumption leads to a general model that logically justifies the additivity of covariate effects and the elimination of interaction terms, even if the dependent variable itself is a nonadditive function. A comparison with earlier methods illustrates other practical advantages of the method: in addition to an absence of residuals or interaction terms, the method can easily handle a large number of covariates and does not require a logically meaningful ordering of covariates. Two empirical examples show that the method can be applied flexibly to a wide variety of decomposition problems. This study also suggests that when data are available at multiple time points over a long interval, it is more accurate to compute an aggregated decomposition based on multiple subintervals than to compute a single decomposition for the entire study period.},

Unlike life expectancy at birth (e0) and median age at death, M is determined solely by old-age mortality as far as mortality follows a bathtub curve. It represents the location of old-age death heap in the age distribution of deaths, and captures mortality shifts more accurately than conditional life expectancies such as e65. Although M may not be directly determined from erratic mortality data, a recently developed method for deriving M from the P-spline-smoothed mortality curve based on penalised Poisson likelihood is highly eﬀective in estimating M. Patterns of trends and diﬀerentials in M can be noticeably diﬀerent from those in other lifespan measures, as indicated in some examples. In addition, major mathematical models of adult mortality such as the Gompertz, logistic and Weibull models can be reformulated using M, which plays a critical role as the mortality level parameter in those models.},

We apply our approach to changes in life expectancy in the United States between 1970 and 2000.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The pace of aging is a concept that captures the time-related aspect of aging. It formalizes the idea of a characteristic life span or intrinsic population time scale. In the rapidly developing ﬁeld of comparative biodemography, measures that account for inter-species differences in life span are needed to compare how species age.
{OBJECTIVE} We aim to provide a mathematical foundation for the concept of pace. We derive desired mathematical properties of pace measures and suggest candidates which satisfy these properties. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of pace-standardization, which reveals differences in demographic quantities that are not due to pace. Examples and consequences are discussed.
{CONCLUSIONS} Mean life span (i.e., life expectancy from birth or from maturity) is intuitively appealing, theoretically justiﬁed, and the most appropriate measure of pace. Pace-standardization provides a serviceable method for comparative aging studies to explore differences in demographic patterns of aging across species, and it may considerably alter conclusions about the strength of aging.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Public interest in social and economic equality is burgeoning. We examine a related phenomenon, lifespan equality, using data from charismatic primate populations and diverse human populations. Our study reveals three key findings. First, lifespan equality rises in lockstep with life expectancy, across primate species separated by millions of years of evolution and over hundreds of years of human social progress. Second, industrial humans differ more from nonindustrial humans in these measures than nonindustrial humans do from other primates. Third, in spite of the astonishing progress humans have made in lengthening the lifespan, a male disadvantage in lifespan measures has remained substantial—a result that will resonate with enduring public interest in male–female differences in many facets of life.
          , 
            The human lifespan has traversed a long evolutionary and historical path, from short-lived primate ancestors to contemporary Japan, Sweden, and other longevity frontrunners. Analyzing this trajectory is crucial for understanding biological and sociocultural processes that determine the span of life. Here we reveal a fundamental regularity. Two straight lines describe the joint rise of life expectancy and lifespan equality: one for primates and the second one over the full range of human experience from average lifespans as low as 2 y during mortality crises to more than 87 y for Japanese women today. Across the primate order and across human populations, the lives of females tend to be longer and less variable than the lives of males, suggesting deep evolutionary roots to the male disadvantage. Our findings cast fresh light on primate evolution and human history, opening directions for research on inequality, sociality, and aging.},

	abstract = {Estimating the true mortality burden of {COVID}-19 for every country in the world is a difﬁcult, but crucial, public health endeavor. Attributing deaths, direct or indirect, to {COVID}-19 is problematic. A more attainable target is the “excess deaths”, the number of deaths in a particular period, relative to that expected during “normal times”, and we estimate this for all countries on a monthly time scale for 2020 and 2021. The excess mortality requires two numbers, the total deaths and the expected deaths, but the former is unavailable for many countries, and so modeling is required for these countries. The expected deaths are based on historic data and we develop a model for producing expected estimates for all countries and we allow for uncertainty in the modeled expected numbers when calculating the excess. We describe the methods that were developed to produce the World Health Organization ({WHO}) excess death estimates. To achieve both interpretability and transparency we developed a relatively simple overdispersed Poisson count framework, within which the various data types can be modeled. We use data from countries with national monthly data to build a predictive log-linear regression model with time-varying coefﬁcients for countries without data. For a number of countries, subnational data only are available, and we construct a multinomial model for such data, based on the assumption that the fractions of deaths in sub-regions remain approximately constant over time. Our inferential approach is Bayesian, with the covariate predictive model being implemented in the fast and accurate {INLA} software. The subnational modeling was carried out using {MCMC} in Stan or in some non-standard data situations, using our own {MCMC} code. Based on our modeling, the point estimate for global excess mortality, over 2020–2021, is 14.9 million, with a 95\% credible interval of (13.3, 16.6) million. This leads to a point estimate of the ratio of excess deaths to reported {COVID}-19 deaths of 2.75, which is a huge discrepancy.},

However, although Lam briefly covered the problems of global warming and pollution, he did not address several other major environmental problems that are closely related to the rapid human population growth in recent decades and to the progress he described. This commentary highlights some of these problems to provide a more balanced perspective on the situation of the world. Specifically, humans currently are using resources at an unsustainable level. Groundwater depletion and overuse of river water are major problems on multiple continents. Fossil fuel resources and several minerals are being depleted. Other major problems include deforestation, with the annual forest clearing globally estimated to be an area the size of New York State; and species extinction, with rates estimated to be 1 00 to 1 ,000 times higher than background rates. Principles of ecological economics are presented that allow an integration of ecology and economic development and better potential for preservation of the world for future generations.},

With public education and imperfect annuity markets, a decline in mortality affects growth through three channels. First, it raises the saving rate and thereby increases the rate of physical capital accumulation. Second, it reduces accidental bequests, lowers investment, and thereby lowers the rate of physical capital accumulation. Third, it may lead the median voter to increase the tax rate for public education initially but lower the tax rate in a later stage. Starting from a high mortality rate as found in many Third World populations, the net effect of a decline in mortality is to raise the growth rate. However, starting from a low mortality rate such as is found in most industrial populations, the net effect of a further decline in mortality is to reduce the growth rate. The findings appear consistent with recent empirical evidence.},

Many observers are concerned that aging will adversely affect public finances and standards of living. Analysis of newly available National Transfer Accounts data for 40 countries shows that fertility well above replacement would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility below replacement would maximize per capita consumption when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account. Although low fertility will indeed challenge government programs and very low fertility undermines living standards, we find that moderately low fertility and population decline favor the broader material standard of living.

	abstract = {The global demographic transition began around 1800 in Europe with declining mortality followed by declining fertility, trends which spread around the world and continue in this century. At the aggregate level, population size greatly increased, growth accelerated and declined with many countries now shrinking, and age distributions inevitably moved from young to old. Population aging has not yet run its course, Its effects exacerbated by declining retirement ages, straining pensions systems and prompting their reform. These aggregate demographic trends reflect profound changes in risks and behavior for individuals and families, and in the shape of the economic life cycle.},

It is important to note that the model investigated represents only a reasonable first step in the direction of reality from the unrealistic assumption that mortality and fertility do not change with passing time. It is shown that this general model can lead to self-excited, persistent oscillations (called limit cycles in mathematical parlance) of the birth trajectory of the population. Using data for the United States from the twentieth century, it is shown that variations in the number of births are consistent with the model discussed.},

            Lee’s (1974) formal demographic feedback models summarize the implications for births and age-structure of neo-Malthusian theories of baby booms such as those of Easterlin. For some parameter values, such models imply sustained cycles, so-called “limit cycles,” in births. Frauenthal and Swick recently reestimated a continuous-age version of Lee’s basic cohort model with U.S. series and, contrary to Lee’s original findings, concluded that “limit cycles oscillations have been occurring in U.S. births.” This article disputes their conclusion, ascribing it to an inconsistency in detrending procedures. Furthermore, it corrects Lee’s original conclusion by showing that his alternative period labor-force feedback model, estimated from U.S. series, leads to cycles of implausibly long period. This article thus reopens the question of whether any feedback model could account for the observed cycles in U.S. births.},

In general, the expectation is of heightened violence as a result of excess men engaging in antisocial behavior and crime, thereby threatening societal stability. While intuitive, these claims are largely unsupported in the literature. Using mating market theory as our guide, we examine indicators of male mating effort, including (1) violent competition between men (homicide, aggravated assault) and (2) indicators of uncommitted sexual behavior (rape, sex offenses, and prostitution). Our unit of analysis is U.S. county-level data. We find that counties with more men have lower rates of crime and violent behavior. Our findings challenge conventional claims of male excess leading to elevated levels of violence. Instead, in support of mating market predictions, we find that criminal and violent behavior related to male mating effort is least common in male-biased sex ratios. We discuss the implications of our findings for public policy regarding incarceration and criminal behavior.},

Theoretical interpretations of this distinctive pattern of change have typically emphasized increasing economic independence for women and reductions in the gains to marriage. In this paper, the authors develop and evaluate an alternative explanation that emphasizes women's continued dependence on men's economic resources and decline in the relative supply of highly educated men. Using data from four rounds of the Japanese National Fertility Survey, the authors decompose the observed decline in marriage rates into changes in the propensity to marry and changes in the educational composition of the marriage market. Results indicate that change in the availability of potential spouses accounts for one-fourth of the decline in marriage among university-educated women and explains a substantial proportion of the growing educational differences in marriage. The conclusion is that the relatively large decline in marriage among highly educated Japanese women likely reflects both increasing economic independence and continued economic dependence on men.},

We say that this age separates “early” from “late” deaths (in terms of their effect on disparity) and investigate the factors determining this threshold age. If life table entropy is less than one, a unique threshold age separating early and late deaths always exists. If life table entropy is greater than one, averting deaths at any age increases disparity. If entropy equals one, averting deaths at age zero has no effect, but averting a death at any age after zero increases disparity.},

If the vital rate measures the rate of production of one type of individual by another, then the sensitivity of growth rate is proportional to the reproductive value of the destination type and the abundance in the stable stage distribution of the source type. This formal relationship exists in three forms: one for age-classiﬁed populations, a second that applies to stage- or age-classiﬁed populations, and a third that uses matrix calculus.

This deﬁnition enables us to derive new relationships for life expectancy.

Equivalently, the expectation of life when the surviving fraction in the life table is s is the average of the reciprocal of the survival-speciﬁc force of mortality over surviving proportions less than s, weighted by life-table deaths at surviving proportions less than s, as shown in (8). Application of these concepts to the 2004 life tables of the United States population and eight subpopulations shows that usually the younger the age at which survival falls to half (the median life length), the longer the life expectancy at that age, contrary to what would be expected from a negative exponential life table.},

It can be considered as the sequel to the concise overview of the {SDT} published earlier in the {US} Proceedings of the National Academy ({PNAS}) (Lesthaeghe, 2014). In the first section, three optimistic views concerning the evolution of fertility are considered: (i) rises due to the end of postponement, (ii) rises connected with advancing human development and (iii) rises associated with advancing gender equality. The focus in this section is mainly but not exclusively on the European experience and its large degree of variation in fertility patterns. It is argued that these three optimistic predictions of sustained fertility rises are mainly based on observations prior to 2010, with too much weight being given to four Nordic countries and too little to other Western European countries with very similar fertility levels. However, these expectations have been thwarted during the second decade, even in the presence of advances in human development and/or gender equality. Hence, the original {SDT} prediction of 1986 of sustained sub-replacement fertility still holds after 35 years. We expect this to continue during the third decade as well.},

Here, we review four key substantive areas of kinship research in demography: (1) kin supply and intergenerational transfers; (2) demographic change; (3) kin loss; and (4) social stratification. For each area, we identify important gaps in the literature and avenues for future research.

We used administrative register data of the entire Swedish population in order to provide the first kinship enumeration for a complete population based on empirical data. We created ego-focused kinship networks of children, parents, siblings, grandchildren, grandparents, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, and cousins. We show both the average number of kin of different types and the distribution of the number of kin as well as how dispersion has changed over time. We show trends for matrilineal and patrilineal kin and also show differences in the kinship structure arising from fertility with more than one childbearing partner, such as half siblings. The results demonstrate extensive variability as well as homogeneity in kinship structure. We discuss our findings in the context of other methods to estimate kinship.},

Unfortunately not much is known about the properties of this estimator. Various demographers have argued informally that it indeed estimates the {SMAM}; others feel that it instead estimates the mean age of marriage in a cohort, the mean age of marriage in the stable population, or the singulate median age of marriage. In this paper the properties of this estimator are examined. Further, extensions of the Van de Walle estimator based on regression are shown to be significantly superior to the estimator alone.},

	abstract = {Tempo effects in period fertility indicators are widely regarded as a source of bias or distortion. But is this always the case? Whether tempo change results in bias depends, in the view advanced here, on the measure used, the meaning of bias/distortion, and the objective of analysis. Two ways of construing bias in period measures are suggested, and their relevance is discussed in the context of five broad purposes for measuring period fertility: describing and explaining fertility time trends, anticipating future prospects, providing input parameters for formal models, and communicating with nonspecialist audiences. Genuine timing effects are not biasing when period fertility is the explanandum but are distorting when the aim is to estimate cohort fertility. Alternatives to tempo adjustment are available that are a more defensible solution to the issue of timing change. Tempo adjustment could be more fruitfully considered a form of modeling rather than empirical measurement. The measurement of period fertility could be improved by relying more on a statistical approach and less on indicators based on stable assumptions. Future progress will depend on integrating research on measurement with substantive investigation.},

            In this paper, I examine temporal changes in U.S. adult mortality by chronic disease cause of death and by sex over a 40-year period in the second half of the twentieth century. I apply age-period-cohort ({APC}) analyses that combine conventional approaches and a new method of model estimation to simultaneously account for age, period, and cohort variations in mortality rates for four leading causes of deaths, including heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The results show that large reductions in mortality since the late 1960s continued well into the late 1990s and that these reductions were predominately contributed by cohort effects. Cohort effects are found to differ by specific causes of death examined, but they generally show substantial survival improvements. Implications of these results are discussed with regard to demographic theories of mortality reductions, differential cohort accumulation of health capital and lifetime exposures to socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors, and period changes in diagnostic techniques and medical treatment.},

To be useful, this chart must allow for the systematic location on one plane of the three classical demographic co-ordinates, namely: the date, the age and the moment of birth. There are three solutions for this problem. In 1869, Zeuner worked out a first solution. In 1870, Brasche proposed a second one with networks of parallels; it is the version most currently used now. In 1874, Becker proposed the third one. In 1875, certainly after Verwey, Lexis took back Zeuner’s diagram and just added networks of parallels. In spite of all this, the name “Lexis diagram” has imposed itself in a seemingly invincible way.},

	abstract = {Since 1940, under conditions of restricted immigration and high and sustained growth in aggregate demand, shifts in the relative number of younger versus older adults have had a pervasive impact on American life. Before 1960, younger males were in increasingly short supply and their relative economic position substantially improved; after 1960, the opposite was true. Since the early sixties, as the relative condition of young adults has deteriorated, marriage has been increasingly deferred and fertility reduced. The labor force participation of young women has risen at above average rates, and that of older women has risen at below average rates. Changes in the age structure of the working age population have also contributed to a combination of rising unemployment and accelerating inflation. Cohort divorce rates, suicide among young males, crime rates, and political alienation have worsened. The rise in college enrollment rates has been interrupted, and {SAT} scores have declined. In contrast, in the period 1940-1960, changes in these various magnitudes were typically of a more favorable sort. The United States is now at the start of a new period of growing scarcity of young adults as a result of the birth rate decline that set in after 1960. This implies that the 1980s will see a turnaround or amelioration in a wide variety of these social, political, and economic conditions, some of which have been taken as symptomatic of a hardening social malaise.},

The present analysis uncovers a possibly realistic ease where an existent mode of balanced growth is `unstable', giving way when slightly perturbed to an asymptotic every-other generation limit cycle of determinable amplitude, and which is stable. The non-linear model utilizes the hypothesis of R. A. Easterlin that age-specific fertility will tend to be lower for age classes that are relatively swollen in total number. By virtue of the law of diminishing returns, wages and feeling of security will tend to be low for such swollen groups. A possible rebound in fertility in the 1980s is implicit in the Easterlin hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that a family's economic status relative to its aspirations (relative economic status) is an important determinant of its fertility behaviour has been developed and applied to the explanation of swings in American fertility by R. A. Easterlin. However, a recent application by Butz and Ward of a model derived from the `new home economics' (pioneered by Becker and Mincer) strongly suggests that relative economic status is not the dominant factor in explaining fertility movements in the U.S.A. Rather, both current men's and women's wages operate independently in explaining the movement in fertility, and in particular the decline in fertility is attributed to rising women's wages. In this paper we explore the relevance of both the Easterlin hypothesis and the hypotheses derived from the `new home economics' to the 1955-75 fertility swing in Great Britain. We find that we must reject the Easterlin hypothesis on the basis of the measures of relative economic status suggested by Easterlin and Wachter. A variant of the Easterlin hypothesis suggested by Oppenheimer does receive some support from the available evidence, and the evidence provides strong support for the model of fertility behaviour derived from the `new home economics', which emphasizes the distinction between the effects of changes in men's and women's real wages on fertility decisions. The cause of the fertility decline is attributed to rising women's wages and employment opportunities through their direct effect on the opportunity cost of time and children among working wives and through their effect on the labour force participation of married women of childbearing age. The test of this model and the estimates of its parameters are not definitive, however, because of deficiencies in the data and problems of statistical estimation. We nevertheless conclude that both this model and the Oppenheimer variant of the Easterlin hypothesis, as well as other elements of a more comprehensive economic theory of fertility, point to a continuation of low fertility and the possibility of a secular decline with fertility approaching some lower asymptote.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Life expectancy is the most widely used measure of mortality, largely because of its intuitive interpretation as the expected age at death of an average individual. Changes in life expectancy are also used to assess mortality trends, but mortality change is incompatible with the assumptions underpinning that intuitive interpretation of life expectancy. To provide an alternative, I return to the two main interpretations of the period life table. The first interpretation, as a synthetic-cohort life table, allows for “forward-looking” probabilistic statements regarding the individual life course. The second interpretation, as stationary population characteristics, yields standardized demographic indicators of the (past) reference period. Interpreting life table indicators such as life expectancy in the first manner is often more appealing, but only the second one makes sense during temporary mortality shocks. The absolute change in life expectancy can then be interpreted as the standardized value of the average lifespan reduction in a past death cohort.},

Using data from 1975 to 2008 for over 100 countries, we show that the reversal exists both in a period and a cohort perspective and is mainly driven by increasing older reproductive-age fertility. We also show that the positive impact of development on fertility in high-development countries is conditional on gender equality: countries ranking high in development as measured by health, income, and education but low in gender equality continue to experience declining fertility. Our findings suggest that gender equality is crucial for countries wishing to reap the fertility dividend of high development.},

            A demographic measure is often expressed as a deterministic or stochastic function of multiple variables (covariates), and a general problem (the decomposition problem) is to assess contributions of individual covariates to a difference in the demographic measure (dependent variable) between two populations. We propose a method of decomposition analysis based on an assumption that covariates change continuously along an actual or hypothetical dimension. This assumption leads to a general model that logically justifies the additivity of covariate effects and the elimination of interaction terms, even if the dependent variable itself is a nonadditive function. A comparison with earlier methods illustrates other practical advantages of the method: in addition to an absence of residuals or interaction terms, the method can easily handle a large number of covariates and does not require a logically meaningful ordering of covariates. Two empirical examples show that the method can be applied flexibly to a wide variety of decomposition problems. This study also suggests that when data are available at multiple time points over a long interval, it is more accurate to compute an aggregated decomposition based on multiple subintervals than to compute a single decomposition for the entire study period.},

Unlike life expectancy at birth (e0) and median age at death, M is determined solely by old-age mortality as far as mortality follows a bathtub curve. It represents the location of old-age death heap in the age distribution of deaths, and captures mortality shifts more accurately than conditional life expectancies such as e65. Although M may not be directly determined from erratic mortality data, a recently developed method for deriving M from the P-spline-smoothed mortality curve based on penalised Poisson likelihood is highly eﬀective in estimating M. Patterns of trends and diﬀerentials in M can be noticeably diﬀerent from those in other lifespan measures, as indicated in some examples. In addition, major mathematical models of adult mortality such as the Gompertz, logistic and Weibull models can be reformulated using M, which plays a critical role as the mortality level parameter in those models.},

Retherford and Cho (1973) devised a method that does not include any interaction terms. However, their method has other limitations, such as the dependence of the results on the order in which the effects of the factors are computed. In this paper, we provide a general method capable of handling any number of factors, which is developed along the lines suggested by Kitagawa and by Retherford and Cho but without the limitations of their methods.},

The existence of tempo distortions is demonstrated in selected period quantum measures such as the total fertility rate and in period tempo measures such as life expectancy. A tempo distortion is defined as an inflation or deflation of a period quantum or tempo indicator of a life-cycle event, such as birth, marriage, or death, that results from a rise or fall in the mean age at which the event occurs. Period measures derived from life tables are also found to be subject to tempo distortions. Methods to remove these tempo distortions are then developed and applied.},

Application of the algorithm easily leads to the known formula for the age-decomposition of differences between two life expectancies. It also allows to develop new formulae for differences between healthy life expectancies. In the latter case, each age-component is split further into effects of mortality and effects of health. The application of the algorithm enables a numerical decomposition of the differences between total fertility rates and between parity progression ratios by age of the mother and parity. Empirical examples are based on mortality data from the {USA}, the {UK}, West Germany, and Poland and on fertility data from Russia.},

            Rectangularization of human survival curves is associated with decreasing variability in the distribution of ages at death. This variability, as measured by the interquartile range of life table ages at death, has decreased from about 65 years to 15 years since 1751 in Sweden. Most of this decline occurred between the 1870s and the 1950s. Since then, variability in age at death has been nearly constant in Sweden, Japan, and the United States, defying predictions of a continuing rectangularization. The United States is characterized by a relatively high degree of variability, compared with both Sweden and Japan. We suggest that the historical compression of mortality may have had significant psychological and behavioral impacts.},

We derive each of these indices from an absorbing Markov chain formulation of the life table, and use matrix calculus to obtain the sensitivity and the elasticity (i.e., the proportional sensitivity) to changes in age-specific mortality. Using empirical French and Russian male data, we compare the underlying sensitivities to mortality change under different mortality regimes to determine the conditions under which the indices might differ in their conclusions about the magnitude of lifespan variation. Finally, we demonstrate how the sensitivities can be used to decompose temporal changes in the indices into contributions of age-specific mortality changes.

Whether tempo change results in bias depends, in the view advanced here, on the measure used, the meaning of bias/distortion, and the objective of analysis. Two ways of construing bias in period measures are suggested, and their relevance is discussed in the context of five broad purposes for measuring period fertility: describing and explaining fertility time trends, anticipating future prospects, providing input parameters for formal models, and communicating with nonspecialist audiences. Genuine timing effects are not biasing when period fertility is the explanandum but are distorting when the aim is to estimate cohort fertility. Alternatives to tempo adjustment are available that are a more defensible solution to the issue of timing change. Tempo adjustment could be more fruitfully considered a form of modeling rather than empirical measurement. The measurement of period fertility could be improved by relying more on a statistical approach and less on indicators based on stable assumptions. Future progress will depend on integrating research on measurement with substantive investigation.},

            In this paper, I examine temporal changes in U.S. adult mortality by chronic disease cause of death and by sex over a 40-year period in the second half of the twentieth century. I apply age-period-cohort ({APC}) analyses that combine conventional approaches and a new method of model estimation to simultaneously account for age, period, and cohort variations in mortality rates for four leading causes of deaths, including heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The results show that large reductions in mortality since the late 1960s continued well into the late 1990s and that these reductions were predominately contributed by cohort effects. Cohort effects are found to differ by specific causes of death examined, but they generally show substantial survival improvements. Implications of these results are discussed with regard to demographic theories of mortality reductions, differential cohort accumulation of health capital and lifetime exposures to socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors, and period changes in diagnostic techniques and medical treatment.},

To be useful, this chart must allow for the systematic location on one plane of the three classical demographic co-ordinates, namely: the date, the age and the moment of birth. There are three solutions for this problem. In 1869, Zeuner worked out a first solution. In 1870, Brasche proposed a second one with networks of parallels; it is the version most currently used now. In 1874, Becker proposed the third one. In 1875, certainly after Verwey, Lexis took back Zeuner’s diagram and just added networks of parallels. In spite of all this, the name “Lexis diagram” has imposed itself in a seemingly invincible way.},

Results show that income of the younger age groups stagnated or declined in most countries since 2008, while income of the older population increased.

Following a brief presentation of the notion of periodicity in population growth, the work dealing with cyclical movements in fertility undertaken by Easterlin along the lines suggested by Kuznets in the {USA} is described. The author suggests that after the end of the transition, fertility will fluctuate cyclically, depending on the relative economic status of young adults. The theoretical relevance of the model, and the validity of the demographic and econometric tests to which it has been submitted are discussed with particular reference to the downswing of the cycle. It shows that Butz and Ward's alternative model in which demand for rather than supply of labour plays the determining role (the rise in women's wages being regarded as particularly important in explaining the recent decline in fertility) cannot account for the recent recovery in birth rates. A study of a long series of net reproduction ratios (1930-1980) in 18 industrialized countries suggests five different types of development of post-transitional fertility. Only two of these could correspond to the beginning of long cycles. The assumption that relative economic status plays a determining part turns out to be debatable and not to be generally true. Finally, a return to a more general explanation, rooted in a consideration of profound historical movements, is suggested.},

It synthesizes the traditional demographic analysis of age-structured renewal with constant vital rates and the economic analysis which treats population change endogenously. When cohort fertility depends on relative cohort size, or when period fertility depends on labor force size, fluctuations of forty or more years replace the traditional "echo" or generation-length cycle. Twentieth-century U. S. fertility change agrees well with the theory, as the "Easterlin Hypothesis" suggests; but the period model fits better than the cohort model.},

This is the "life-cycle squeeze"-the situation where a man's resources are inadequate to meet the needs engendered by the number and ages of his children. Studies of how economic needs vary by family life-cycle stage indicate that one high point of need occurs when men are in their forties and early fifties. However, 1960 Census data on earnings patterns by age indicate that in only relatively high-level professional, managerial and sales occupations do average earnings peak at the same time family income needs are peaking. For most blue-collar and many medium- and low-level white collar occupations, median earnings are highest for younger men, and men at an age when family costs are at their maximum are earning somewhat less, on the average. As a consequence, the families of such men run the risk of a deterioration in their level of living unless an additional income is brought into the household.},

In this study, I examine differences in childlessness among the highly educated by studying how educational prestige, social class, and income are associated with the likelihood of becoming a father. Higher income and social class background are positively associated with fatherhood, and this association has not changed over time. Educational prestige (higher degrees, or degrees from traditional universities) is not positively associated with fatherhood, while 2-year degrees have become more positively associated with fatherhood over time. The findings of this study suggest that socioeconomic resources are important for men’s family formation in Sweden compared to educational resources, contrary to expectations from educational homophily and partner market perspectives.},

Our data covers all men living in Norway during 1970-2006 which allows for a detailed analysis of diversity along a wide range of different educational groups and cohorts. Childlessness among men is most pronounced among those with low education and least pronounced among those with high edu-cation, but at a given educational level, we also observe sharp contrasts be-tween men within different fields of education. The educational pattern of multi-partner fertility is different from childlessness, as the propensity to have children with more than one woman is most pronounced among those with low education.},

            In this article, we describe a general framework for the analysis of correlated event histories, with an application to a study of partnership transitions and fertility among a cohort of British women. Using a multilevel, multistate competing-risks model, we examine the relationship between prior fertility outcomes (the presence and characteristics of children and current pregnancy) and the dissolution of marital and cohabiting unions and movements from cohabitation to marriage. Using a simultaneous-equations model, we model these partnership transitions jointly with fertility, allowing for correlation between the unobserved woman-level characteristics that affect each process. The analysis is based on the partnership and birth histories that were collected for the 1958 birth cohort (National Child Development Study) aged 16–42. The findings indicate that preschool children have a stabilizing effect on their parents’ partnership, whether married or cohabiting, but the effect is weaker for older children. There is also evidence that although pregnancy precipitates marriage among cohabitors, the odds of marriage decline to prepregnancy levels following a birth.},

A shortage of men in a marriage market is associated with lower relationship quality for unmarried parents. Male shortages are associated with lower rates of marriage following a nonmarital birth, in part because of the mediating influence of relationship quality. A shortage of men is not significantly related to the economic quality of male, nonmarital childbearing partners.},

	abstract = {In this paper the relative impact of education, income and housing on first birth propensities in Sweden from the early 1970s until 2009 is studied. Both objective and subjective measures of these three factors are used. Data is derived from The Swedish Housing and Life Course Cohort Study ({HOLK}, cohorts born 1956, 1964 and 1974) and the Young Adult Panel Study ({YAPS}, cohorts born 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1980). The analysis of objective measures indicates that educational attainment is of little importance for first birth propensities while income is of greater importance. Dwelling size is positively related to first birth propensities for all cohorts, while establishment on the housing market matter only for the 1974 cohort. In the analysis of the subjective evaluations of the three factors, having a sufficient income seems to be the most influential, even if having completed one’s education and having a suitable housing situation also have positive effects. We conclude that our analyses give substantial support to the Hobcraft-Kiernan scheme of the necessary preconditions for the transition to parenthood in modern societies. Education, income, and housing are all important prerequisites for having a first birth, both when measured objectively and when we consider the individual’s subjective evaluation of these factors.},

	title = {Methodological report: measurement of education-specific mating squeeze},
	abstract = {A long-standing theory in family demography points out that marriage rates for both men and women are affected by the number of suitable marriage partners available in the local marriage market. In its most basic form, the marriage squeeze hypothesis holds that marriage prospects are lower if the number of unmarried persons of the desired age is low. We propose to update the concept of the marriage squeeze in ways that make it more relevant for partnership and family formation today. This entails at least two things. First, given the increasing importance of unmarried cohabitation and given the fact that a growing proportion of children are born outside marriage in Europe, the concept and idea of the "marriage squeeze" should be broadened to include the effects of age-specific sex ratio imbalances on the "mating market" rather than on the marriage market only. That is: we should incorporate unmarried cohabitation. Second, education should be added to the dimensions of age and sex to quantify the mating squeeze in a more meaningful way. The expansion of higher education among women implies that women who want to find a male partner with the same or a higher level of educational attainment would increasingly experience an education-specific mating squeeze. Therefore, this paper reviews ways of measuring the education-specific mating squeeze and presents time series of measurements based on alternative methods and two different sources: the European Labour Force Survey ({LFS}) and Eurostat official statistics on population by five years age groups and sex.},

For the first time in European history, there are now more highly educated women than men reaching the reproductive ages and looking for a partner.

These traditional practices are no longer compatible with the new gender distribution in education. The objective of this paper is to formulate hypotheses about the consequences for reproductive behaviour in Europe. I expect the following causal chain between the reversal of the gender imbalance in education ({RGIE}) and fertility: {RGIE} creates a new, education-specific mating squeeze that affects the process and expected pattern of assortative mating, which in turns affects the timing, probability and stability of union formation, which eventually is expected to have implications for fertility.

Nonetheless, the literature does not contain a clear definition of exactly what a marriage squeeze is and contains few quantitative estimates of its impact on marriage. The present article provides a precise definition of the marriage squeeze in equation (2), and applies it to measure both artificially produced marriage squeezes in two-sex nuptiality stable populations and the experience of the United States during the period 1950-1990. The marriage squeeze is shown to be capable of producing significant changes in both the level and distribution of marriage, and it appears to be having such an impact in some contemporary Third World societies. For developed countries in general and for the United States in particular, the marriage squeeze exerts little influence on the level of marriage but has a considerable effect on the distribution of marriages. The U.S. age-sex composition of the year 1978, compared to that of the year 1951, is shown to imply a 0.54 year decrease in the male mean age at marriage and a 0.53 year increase in the female mean age at marriage, as well as an 18 percent reduction in the variance of the male ages at marriage and a 33 percent increase in the variance of the female ages. The social and economic implications of such changes have yet to be fully explored.},

Although changes in fertility and in mortality are contributing factors, the “real” squeeze is due largely to the ubiquitous norm that husbands should be older than their wives. This mating gradient is the most significant determinant of the competition for mates as it is experienced by older unmarried women compared with older unmarried men. The nature and magnitude of this marriage squeeze are demonstrated using Canadian vital statistics and census data. Age differentials of brides and grooms in all marriages registered in 1981 are used to create “availability indices” that estimate the number of unmarried persons of the opposite sex that are potentially available for every 100 unmarried persons. For men, availability indices are low in the 20s, and they increase with advancing age to about one-to-one in the 50s. For women, access to potential grooms is highest in the 20s and decreases with advancing age until, in the 50s, there are only 50 potential grooms per 100 unmarried women. The implications of unbalanced sex ratios are discussed with reference to changes in marriage and the family. Markedly skewed sex ratios may shift the balance of power between the sexes and produce a demographic reaffirmation of the double standard.},

If either of these numbers exceeds the other, the corresponding sex is in a "marriage squeeze." The comparison among the expected number of grooms, that of brides, and the observed number of marriages supplies information on the effects of the squeeze.},

	abstract = {This review explores whether and how imbalances in the number of men and women—the sex ratio—affects mating competition. I evaluate the available evidence against two hypotheses: a mating supply and demand hypothesis, which predicts mate competition to increase when mates are scarce, and predictions from a ‘faithful as your options’ hypothesis, which suggests mate competition should increase with a surplus of mates because the returns to mating effort are greatest. Men’s mating effort consistently increased with a surplus of mates, supporting the ‘faithful as your options’ hypothesis, but results for women’s mating effort were mixed. Some measures supported the mating supply and demand hypothesis, some supported the ‘faithful as your options’ hypothesis, and some found no relationship with the sex ratio. Socioeconomic development may explain variation in sex ratio effects for women if men are better able to constrain women’s mating effort in traditional societies, or other variables, like variation in mate quality, may better explain women’s mate competition.},

Our measures remove the former distortion and provide means to assess the latter aging effect. The measures therefore provide a uniﬁed toolkit of fertility indices that (a) facilitate the description and analysis of past period fertility trends in terms of synthetic cohort measures, and (b) allow the projection of the timing, level and distribution of cohort fertility conditional on a speciﬁc postponement scenario. Due to their explicit relation to cohort behavior, these measures extend and improve the existing adjustment of the total fertility rate. We apply these methods to Sweden from 1970 to 1999.},

Patterns of assortative mating have also changed as highly educated women increasingly form relationships with men who have less education (hypogamous unions). In this article, we draw on rich register data from Sweden to ask whether the emergence of hypogamous unions signals the emergence of a new female status dominance in unions. We also consider how the status distribution in these unions compares to homogamous (both highly educated) or hypergamous (he highly educated) unions. We use Swedish register data and study couples who have their ﬁrst child together. We refer to a multi-dimensional view of status and use indicators of social class background, income, and occupational prestige. We ﬁnd that in hypogamous unions, women tend to have a higher social class background and occupational prestige, but lower income than their partners. The income gap between partners is not simply a consequence of the gender wage gap, but driven by selection into different union types. Men and women who form hypogamous unions are negatively selected in terms of their income.},

	abstract = {Social learning and life history interact in human adaptation, but nearly all models of the evolution of social learning omit age structure and population regulation. Further progress is hindered by a poor appreciation of how life history affects selection on learning. We discuss why life history and age structure are important for social learning and present an exemplary model of the evolution of social learning in which demographic properties of the population arise endogenously from assumptions about
              per capita
              vital rates and different forms of population regulation. We find that, counterintuitively, a stronger reliance on social learning is favoured in organisms characterized by ‘fast’ life histories with high mortality and fertility rates compared to ‘slower’ life histories typical of primates. Long lifespans make early investment in learning more profitable and increase the probability that the environment switches within generations. Both effects favour more individual learning. Additionally, under fertility regulation (as opposed to mortality regulation), more juveniles are born shortly after switches in the environment when many adults are not adapted, creating selection for more individual learning. To explain the empirical association between social learning and long life spans and to appreciate the implications for human evolution, we need further modelling frameworks allowing strategic learning and cumulative culture.

Although the current inequality in the risks of widowhood and widowerhood for the average couple is mostly due to sex differences in mortality, a one year age difference between spouses has about the same impact as does a one year difference in life expectancy. Calculations based on current distributions of age of groom by age of bride indicate that the older the age of groom, the greater the age difference between spouses and the higher the likelihood of a woman outliving her husband: the typical groom who marries in his fifties faces a 4 to 1 chance that he will be outlived by his spouse.},

To counteract the limitations of cross-sectional methods commonly used to assess the severity of marriage squeezes, I use a two-sex cohort-based procedure to simulate marriage patterns over the twenty-first century based on the female dominance model. I also examine two more-flexible marriage functions to illustrate the potential impact of changes in marriage schedules as a response to the marriage squeeze. Longitudinal indicators of marriage squeeze indicate that the number of prospective grooms in both countries will exceed that of prospective brides by more 50\% for three decades in the most favorable scenario. Rates of male bachelorhood will not peak before 2050, and the squeeze conditions will be felt several decades thereafter, even among cohorts unaffected by adverse {SRB}. If the {SRB} is allowed to return to normalcy by 2020, the proportion of men unmarried at age 50 is expected to rise to 15\% in China by 2055 and to 10\% in India by 2065.

Our study population consists of all couples who had a first child and their parents, in every year between 1980 and 2007. Tertiary education is typically associated with decreased intergenerational proximity. We examine how increased enrolment has influenced distance to parents by using administrative register data for the complete population of Sweden. We perform a decomposition analysis, examining how the big expansion of tertiary education in Sweden during our study period has influenced intergenerational proximity. An explicit policy goal of this expansion was to widen the geographical access to tertiary education, and the government increased enrolment at newer regional institutions during this period. We additionally explore if the expansion of these newer tertiary institutions influenced average distance to parents. We find that intergenerational distances increased over the study period, and that this mainly was attributed to the increased enrolment at older tertiary universities. The expansion of regional tertiary institutions throughout Sweden had a small negative effect on intergenerational distance.},

	abstract = {When women are scarce in a population relative to men, they have greater bargaining power in romantic relationships and thus may be able to secure male commitment at earlier ages. Male motivation for long-term relationship commitment may also be higher, in conjunction with the motivation to secure a prospective partner before another male retains her. However, men may also need to acquire greater social status and resources to be considered marriageable. This could increase the variance in male marital age, as well as the average male marital age. We calculated the Operational Sex Ratio, and means, medians, and standard deviations in marital ages for women and men for the 50 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States with 2000 U.S Census data. As predicted, where women are scarce they marry earlier on average. However, there was no significant relationship with mean male marital ages. The variance in male marital age increased with higher female scarcity, contrasting with a non-significant inverse trend for female marital age variation. These findings advance the understanding of the relationship between the {OSR} and marital patterns. We believe that these results are best accounted for by sex specific attributes of reproductive value and associated mate selection criteria, demonstrating the power of an evolutionary framework for understanding human relationships and demographic patterns.},

We provide novel insights into how education and life stage might modify the link between unemployment and fertility. We focus on a Nordic welfare state, Finland, and apply event history models to a rich register sample covering the years 1988–2009 (N = 306,413). We ﬁnd that unemployment or a weaker labour market attachment tends to delay parenthood among both men and women, but the association is stronger for men. In most groups, the accumulation of unemployment periods is associated with a lower rate of entry into parenthood. However, among young, low-educated women, even long-term or recurring unemployment seems to promote ﬁrst childbearing, and the generally negative association between unemployment and entry into parenthood does not apply to young, low-educated men. The eﬀect of unemployment is largely mediated by the low income of unemployed persons. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that in a modern, gender-egalitarian welfare society, better employment prospects promote transition to parenthood in a very similar fashion among men and women, but the eﬀects are strongly modiﬁed by education and life course stage.},

Furthermore in countries with distorted fertility, the pattern of first births also exhibits an intense hump in younger ages, stronger than that of the total fertility pattern.

The penalized spline (P-spline) approach is particularly useful for these purposes, but it in small samples it can often produce implausible age schedule estimates.
{OBJECTIVE} I propose and evaluate a new type of P-spline model for estimating demographic rate schedules. These estimators, which I call D-splines, regularize and smooth highdimensional splines by using demographic patterns rather than generic mathematical rules.
{METHODS} I compare P-spline estimates of age-speciﬁc mortality rates to three alternative D-spline estimators, over a large number of simulated small populations with known rates. The penalties for the D-spline estimators are derived from patterns in the Human Mortality Database.
{RESULTS} For mortality estimates in small populations, D-spline estimators generally have lower errors than standard P-splines.
{CONCLUSIONS} Using penalties based on demographic information about patterns and variability in rate schedules improves P-spline estimators for small populations. {CONTRIBUTION} This paper expands demographers’ toolkit by developing a new category of P-spline estimators that are more reliable for estimating mortality in small populations.},

Previous research shows that as sex ratios become female-biased, women from economically deprived areas are less likely to delay reproductive opportunities to wait for a high-investing mate but instead begin their reproductive careers sooner. Here, we show that the local sex ratio also has an impact on female fertility schedules. At young ages, a female-biased ratio is associated with higher birth rates in the poorest areas, whereas the opposite is true for the richest areas. At older ages, a female-biased ratio is associated with higher birth rates in the richest, but not the poorest areas. These patterns suggest that female–female competition encourages poorer women to adopt a fast life-history strategy and give birth early, and richer women to adopt a slow life-history strategy and delay reproduction.},

	abstract = {The ratio of men and women in the adult population, i.e. sex ratio, has long been recognized as a key demographic constraint for partnering behavior. However, the literature remains contradictory on how sex ratio imbalances influence partnering behavior, suggesting either higher or lower rates of male marriage being associated with male-skewed sex ratios. These contradictory findings are likely due to data limitations. Cross-sectional data or limited observation periods preclude studies from distinguishing sex ratio effects on timing from effects on the overall likelihood of marriage. In this paper, we use historical family reconstitution data to study the association of sex ratios with marriage patterns in the French colony of the St. Lawrence Valley in North America (1680–1750). The population experienced a substantial male-skew from sex-selective immigration during the early period of the colony. The long-running observation period allow for differentiating the timing and overall likelihood of marriage. Finally, the data enable us to study the effects of male-skews on the populationlevel as well as the regional and parish level. Cox proportional hazard models reveal that while male-skewed sex ratios are associated earlier marriage for women, the association with men’s marital biographies is less clear-cut. We find that men marry later when sex ratios are more male-skewed, yet we do not find a substantial reduction in the overall likelihood of marriage for men. Our findings reveal that male-skewed sex ratios do not necessarily result in an increase of never married men. We discuss the implications of our findings for the sex ratio literature.},

	abstract = {Sex ratios have widely been recognized as an important link between demographic contexts and behavior because changes in the ratio shift sex-specific bargaining power in the partner market. Implicitly, the literature considers individual partner market experiences to be a function of local sex ratios. However, empirical evidence on the correspondence between subjective partner availability and local sex ratios is lacking so far. In this paper, we analyzed how closely a set of different local sex ratio measures correlates with subjective partner market experiences. Linking a longitudinal German survey to population data for different entities (states, counties, municipalities), we used multilevel logistic regression models to explore associations between singles’ subjective partner market experiences and various operationalizations of local sex ratios. Results suggest that local sex ratios correlated only weakly with subjective partner market experiences. Adult sex ratios based on broad age brackets, including those for lower-level entities, did not significantly predict whether individuals predominantly met individuals of their own sex. More finegrained, age-specific sex ratios prove to be better predictors of subjective partner market experiences, in particular when age hypergamy patterns were incorporated. Nevertheless, the respective associations were only significant for selected measures. In a complementary analysis, we illustrate the validity of the subjective indicator as a predictor of relationship formation. In sum, our results suggest that subjective partner availability is not adequately represented by the broad adult sex ratio measures that are frequently used in the literature. Future research should be careful not to equate local sex ratios and conscious partner market experiences.},

	abstract = {A large body of research focuses on the (socio)economic antecedents of marriage dissolution. Less is known about the factors that affect the stability of cohabitations. The focus in this study, which is based on Finnish register data, is on whether the socioeconomic resources of the partners affect the stability of cohabitations and marriages in a similar way. According to the results, a lower level of education, unemployment (of the man in particular) and the male partner's (or the couple's) low income increased dissolution rates in unions of both types. The stabilizing effects of each partner's high educational level as well as the male partner's employment and high income were stronger in marriages. The union types also seemed to differ in that the separation-promoting effect of the female partner's high (absolute or relative) income was stronger in marriages, but high-income women are few and the interactions between union type and the income of the female partner were statistically insignificant. The overall conclusion is that in the Finnish context, the socioeconomic antecedents of union dissolution are remarkably similar in cohabitations and marriages, but socioeconomic resources are somewhat more important for the stability of marriages. Only weak support was found for the idea that cohabitations are more compatible with income equality. Un grand nombre d'études s'intéresse aux antécédents socio-économiques des dissolutions de mariage. Les facteurs qui ont une influence sur la stabilité des cohabitations sont moins connus. Cet article, basé sur des données du registre finlandais, étudie si les ressources socio-économiques des partenaires affectent de la même manière la stabilité des cohabitations et des mariages. Nos résultats montrent qu'un plus bas niveau d'instruction, le chômage (de l'homme en particulier), et de faibles revenus du partenaire masculin (ou du couple) augmentent les taux de dissolution pour les deux types d'union. Les effets stabilisateurs d'un niveau d'instruction élevé pour chacun des partenaires, d'un emploi pour le partenaire masculin et de revenus élevés étaient plus importants pour les mariages. Les résultats différent selon le type d'union. L'effet positif sur les ruptures d'un revenu élevé (absolu ou relatif) de la partenaire féminine était plus fort dans le cas de mariage, mais le nombre de femmes avec un haut niveau de revenus est faible et les interactions entre le type d'unions et le revenu de la partenaire féminine sont statistiquement non-significatifs. En conclusion, dans le contexte finlandais, les antécédents socio-économiques des dissolutions d'union sont remarquablement similaires, mais les ressources socio-économiques ont un effet un peu plus marqué sur la stabilité des mariages. L'hypothèse qu'une égalité de revenus soit plus compatible avec la cohabitation se trouve peu appuyée par nos résultats.},

Community characteristics may be barriers to divorce, or they may increase the attractiveness of divorcing (e. g., access to a good remarriage market), but our knowledge of such influences is sparse. This study examines two such community-level factors: socio-economic conditions and the local marriage market. In this study, discrete-time hazard models with community-level fixed effects are estimated using register-based data on Norwegian first marriages during the period from 1980 to 1999, with longitudinal information on both the community and couple levels (N = 283,493). The results show that there are important community-level influences on couples' divorce risk, but these change dramatically when fixed effects are introduced. La décision de divorcer peut être influencée par les caractéristiques communautaires locales. Ces dernières peuvent constituer soit des freins à la décision de divorcer, soit augmenter son attractivité (du fait par exemple d'un marché matrimonial étendu), mais nos connaissances quant à ces influences restent partielles. Cette étude s'intéresse à deux facteurs au niveau communautaire : les conditions socio-économiques et le marché matrimonial local. Des modèles de risque à temps discret avec effets fixes pour les variables communautaires, sont estimés à partir de registres relatifs aux premiers mariages en Norvège pour la période allant de 1980 à 1999, et d'informations longitudinales tant pour la communauté que pour le couple (N = 283.493). Les résultats montrent que les caractéristiques communautaires ont une influence importante sur la probabilité de divorcer, mais la prise en compte des effets fixes modifie considérablement ces résultats.},

	abstract = {In most countries, men are more likely to be childless than women. Understanding how this inequality arises is important given the significance of parenthood for individuals’ lives. The objective of this study was to explore how three prominent explanations for sex inequalities in childlessness relate to the Sex Gap in Childlessness ({SGC}) in Sweden. The three explanations examined were sex ratio imbalance (more men than women), mismeasurement of fatherhood (inequalities in registration) and partnership differences (inequality in multi-partner fertility). Administrative register data for cohorts born in 1945–1974 were used. The population was restricted to men and women who were born in Sweden or arrived prior to the age of 15, and all registered childbearing partnerships were examined. To explore the possible significance of the three explanations, counter-factual standardization was used. Of the three explanations examined, the population sex ratio had the largest positive impact on the {SGC}, while multi-partner fertility had a negative impact. The results show that inequalities in the sex ratio can explain about 20–34\% of the {SGC} depending on cohort. Inequalities in registration of fathers explain about 9–24\% of the {SGC} depending on cohort. Finally, results show that women are slightly more likely to have multiple partners, and that this behaviour has a substantial minimizing effect on the {SGC} (minimizing it by 6–65\%). To the authors’ knowledge this was the first paper to estimate the scope of the impacts of these three mechanisms on the {SGC}. Differences in multi-partner fertility have in many instances been used as an explanation for men’s higher childlessness. This study shows that women have slightly more childbearing partners than men, and that this actually leads to a smaller {SGC} in the studied population.},

Female childlessness at ages 40–44 years remains low (below or at 10\%) in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Russia, moderate (11–15\%) in France, Belgium, Georgia, Germany, Norway, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden, and the {US}, and high (around 20\%) in Austria, Italy, Finland, the Netherlands and the {UK}. Male lifetime childlessness is highest (above 23\% among men aged 45–49) in Finland, Italy, Germany, the {UK} and the Czech Republic. Childlessness is more common among men with little education, and among women with either very high or very low education. Childlessness is higher in countries where mean age at marriage is high and entry into motherhood is on average more delayed. Childlessness remains negatively associated with proportions ever married, and also with completed cohort fertility. The last association has even grown stronger in the youngest cohorts, suggesting that in a low fertility context, increasing childlessness contributes markedly to overall fertility. The prevalence of childlessness does not seem to be associated with proportions of women with high education, with women’s employment rates and with divorce rates at country level. Higher childlessness is found in countries with widespread individualist values.},

	abstract = {Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study summarizes the most commonly used spatial regression models and offers a comparison of their performance by using Monte Carlo experiments. In contrast to previous simulations, this study evaluates the bias of the impacts rather than the regression coefficients and additionally provides results for situations with a nonspatial omitted variable bias. Results reveal that the most commonly used spatial autoregressive and spatial error specifications yield severe drawbacks. In contrast, spatial Durbin specifications ({SDM} and {SDEM}) and the simple spatial lag of X ({SLX}) provide accurate estimates of direct impacts even in the case of misspecification. Regarding the indirect ?spillover? effects, several?quite realistic?situations exist in which the {SLX} outperforms the more complex {SDM} and {SDEM} specifications.},

Conditional logit models are appropriate when the choice among alternatives is modeled as a function of the characteristics of the alternatives, rather than (or in addition to) the characteristics of the individual making the choice. We argue that this feature of conditional logit makes it more appropriate for estimating behavioral models. In this article, the conditional logit model is presented and compared with the more familiar multinomial logit model. The difference between the two techniques is illustrated with an analysis of the choice of marital and welfare status by divorced or separated women.},

The focus is on the distinction between statistical signiﬁcance and substantive, sociological signiﬁcance. We review all articles published in the European Sociological Review between 2000–2004 and 2010–2014 that use regression models (N ¼ 356). Our main aim is to determine whether the authors discuss the effect size of their ﬁndings and distinguish substantive from statistical signiﬁcance. We apply a ﬁve-item questionnaire to each article and ﬁnd that about half of the articles erroneously interpret a statistically insigniﬁcant coefﬁcient as a zero effect, while only one in three engage in a discussion of the substantive meaning of the effect sizes. Moreover, our ﬁndings show a negative trend in the practice of signiﬁcance testing over the past 15 years. These results are similar to those of the comparable review in the ﬁeld of economics. We conclude by providing a set of recommendations on how to reduce the misuse of signiﬁcance testing in sociological research, through an informed benchmarking of the ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {If marriage markets were only subject to the influences of numerical supply and demand, one would expect that the scarcer sex in a population would have a greater proportion married. Previous research has demonstrated that when males are scarce, they are actually less likely to be married, presumably because their market scarcity enhances their short term mating success and decreases incentives for commitment. However, males in modern societies appear to shift from mating effort to parental investment across the life course. Also, women preferentially value indicators of phenotypic quality for short term relationships, and these signals may be increasingly difficult to display with progressive physiological senescence. We predicted that men in low sex ratio populations would use market scarcity to their advantage for mating effort when young, but would shift towards commitment strategies when older. Data from the 50 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the {USA} confirmed that a female biased sex ratio was associated with a lower proportion of men married between ages 20 and 29, but a higher proportion of men married between ages 35 and 74.},

We generated and tested two hypotheses about the cross-cultural relationships between sex ratio and mate preferences using preference ratings of 18 characteristics provided by 9809 participants and corresponding sex ratio data secured from an international organization. The Classical Sex Ratio Mate Preference Shifts Hypothesis predicts that in imbalanced sex ratio societies, the more numerous sex will lower their standards, to facilitate acquisition of a partner of the less numerous sex. The Alternative Sex Ratio Mate Preference Shifts Hypothesis predicts that in lower sex ratio societies, men will lower their standards to secure more short-term matings, whereas women will raise their standards to avoid deception by men seeking short-term relationships. Results supported the Classical Sex Ratio Mate Preference Shifts Hypothesis for men, and the Alternative Sex Ratio Mate Preference Shifts Hypothesis for women. Discussion addresses limitations of the current research and highlights future directions for research on the relationships between sex ratio and mating psychology and behavior.

In this study, 71 heterosexual men were randomly assigned to one of two mate availability priming conditions, mate scarcity or mate abundance, and subsequently completed measures of sociosexuality as well as infidelity intentions. Results indicated that men in the mate abundance condition reported stronger sociosexual attitudes and desires, and among those currently in relationships, stronger infidelity intentions. These findings were contrasted with those from a separate sample of 66 heterosexual undergraduate women. Mate scarcity had no effects on women's sociosexuality or infidelity intentions. Findings suggest that when mates are scarce, men will adopt a sociosexual orientation aimed at maintaining a single partner.},

	abstract = {There is great debate surrounding the demographic impact of China’s population control policies, especially the one-birth restrictions, which ended only recently. We apply an objective, data-driven method to construct the total fertility rates and population size of a ‘synthetic China’, which is assumed to be not subjected to the two major population control policies implemented in the 1970s. We find that while the earlier, less restrictive ‘later-longer-fewer’ policy introduced in 1973 played a critical role in driving down the fertility rate, the role of the ‘one-child policy’ introduced in 1979 and its descendants was much less significant. According to our model, had China continued with the less restrictive policies that were implemented in 1973 and followed a standard development trajectory, the path of fertility transition and total population growth would have been statistically very similar to the pattern observed over the past three decades.

We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged men have the lowest chance of becoming fathers and the lowest likelihood of fathering multiple children in stable unions. Multipartner fertility, on the other hand, is positively associated with both disadvantage and advantage: higher-order birth risks with a new partner are more prevalent among men with low as well as high socioeconomic status. An intervening factor among disadvantaged men may be a higher union dissolution risk, and an elevated risk among advantaged men may be associated with their higher preferences for children and other features that make these men more attractive to women as partners and fathers of future children.},

Lucas (Bell J Econ 9(2):508–523, 1978) shows how management quality plays a role in determining output. The baby boom’s entry into the workforce resulted in more managers from smaller, pre-baby boom cohorts. These marginal managers were necessarily of lower quality, leading to a drop in total factor productivity. As the boomers aged, this effect was reversed. A calibrated model of managers, workers, and ﬁrms suggests that the management effects of the baby boom may explain roughly 20\% of the observed productivity slowdown and resurgence.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to distinguish between two alternative views of the labour-market problems faced by young workers in a number of industrialized countries in the 1970s and early 1980s. The first view is that the low relative earnings and high unemployment rates experienced by these cohorts were largely age-related; the second is that they are a consequence of large cohort size. A multi-country empirical analysis indicates that large cohort size tends to have a negative effect on the expected earnings (product of earnings and the employment-to-labour-force ratio) of a cohort; there is, moreover, a marked trade-off between the relative-earnings effect and the relative-employment effect, with large cohort sizes reducing relative earnings in some countries and relative employment in others. More detailed data for the {USA} show that the relatively low wages and high unemployment of the 'unlucky' cohorts have tended to converge to the patterns that would have resulted had the cohorts been more ' normal' in size, but that their lifetime income has been permanently reduced. Finally, baby-boom cohorts in several countries are shown to have been absorbed in a wide range of industries rather than through expansion of the traditionally youth-intensive industries.},

Little is known about childless elderly in the Third World. This paper provides some theoretical background to the study of childless elderly and articulates some social policy concerns about them. It suggests that there are five important questions to examine concerning the fives of childless elderly. These include, how childless aged are or are not provided for in societies in which a great deal of the care of the aged is undertaken by children; how kinship functions as a matrix for care; how the increasingly common phenomenon of voluntary childless may give meaning to childlessness in late life; how childlessness fits with such social science models such as "the developmental cycle"; and, the relationship of this phenomenon to changing opportunities for women. The paper further examines how factors such as fertility, systems of caregiving, the social meaning of childlessness, alternatives to childlessness such as adoption, and educational and economic opportunities may affect the lives of childless elders.},

However, while the adult sex ratio ({ASR}) has long been recognized as an important link between demography and behaviour, this relationship remains understudied. Here, we introduce the first inter-disciplinary collection of research on the causes and consequences of variation in the {ASR} in human and animal societies. This important topic is relevant to a wide audience of both social and biological scientists due to the central role that the relative number of males to females in a population plays for the evolution of, and contemporary variation in, sex roles across groups, species and higher taxa. The articles in this theme issue cover research on {ASR} across a variety of taxa and topics. They offer critical re-evaluations of theoretical foundations within both evolutionary and non-evolutionary fields, and propose innovative methodological approaches, present new empirical examples of behavioural consequences of {ASR} variation and reveal that the {ASR} plays a major role in determining population viability, especially in small populations and species with labile sex determination. This introductory paper puts the contributions of the theme issue into a broader context, identifies general trends across the literature and formulates directions for future research.

We merge data from the 1999–2000 Chinese Health and Family Life Survey with community-level data from the 1982, 1990, and 2000 Chinese censuses to examine the relationship between the local sex ratio and several dimensions of men’s sexual behavior and sexual health. Multilevel logistic regression models show that, when faced with a relative abundance of agematched women in their community, Chinese men are slightly less likely to have intercourse with commercial sex workers, but are more likely to engage in premarital noncommercial intercourse and to test positive for a sexually transmitted infection. These findings are consistent with hypotheses derived from demographicopportunity theory, which suggests that an abundance of opposite-sex partners will increase the risk of early, frequent, and multi-partner sex and, through this, sexually transmitted infection risk.},

Findings show that relationship formation is unaffected by partner availability, yet the presence of partners increases women’s odds of cohabiting, decreases men’s odds of cohabiting, and increases number of dating partners and cheating among men. It appears that sex ratios influence not only transitions in and out of marriage, but also the process through which individuals search for and evaluate partners prior to marriage.},

In this study, 71 heterosexual men were randomly assigned to one of two mate availability priming conditions, mate scarcity or mate abundance, and subsequently completed measures of sociosexuality as well as infidelity intentions. Results indicated that men in the mate abundance condition reported stronger sociosexual attitudes and desires, and among those currently in relationships, stronger infidelity intentions. These findings were contrasted with those from a separate sample of 66 heterosexual undergraduate women. Mate scarcity had no effects on women’s sociosexuality or infidelity intentions. Findings suggest that when mates are scarce, men will adopt a sociosexual orientation aimed at maintaining a single partner.},

Familistic cultures represent different demands on informal support and social care, bringing enormous importance to the heiresses generations. Interpersonal relationships between generations are fueled by reciprocity in support throughout the life cycle. Intergenerationality closes its cycle when the offspring support their parents in older ages. Normativity in this cycle is broken with childlessness, which is less and less exceptional today. The emphasis on family ties in social care and the childless population’s increase transform future support expectations, challenging societies.},

By time-reversal starting with the epoch at which Ego is sampled, it is shown that the number of offspring of Ego's parent (Ego plus siblings) and the number of offspring of Ego's grandparent (Ego's parent plus Ego's parent's siblings) have the same distribution, and the probability generating function (p.g.f.) is obtained in terms of the reproduction p.g.f. Further development of the method yields the joint p.g.f. of any number of generations prior, and subsequent, to that of Ego.

Using Survey of Consumer Finances data from 1989 through 2013, we compare wealth levels between and within the two groups that make up America’s dependents: the elderly and child households (households with a resident child aged 18 or younger). Over the observed period, the absolute wealth gap between elderly and child households in the United States increased substantially, and diverging trends in wealth accumulation exacerbated preexisting between-group disparities. Widening gaps were particularly pronounced among the least-wealthy elderly and child households. Differential demographic change in marital status and racial composition by subgroup do not explain the widening gap. We also find increasing wealth inequality within child households and the rise of a “parental 1 \%.” During a time of overall economic growth, the elderly have been able to maintain or increase their wealth, whereas many of the least-wealthy child households saw precipitous declines. Our findings suggest that many child households may lack sufficient assets to promote the successful flourishing of the next generation.},

Improving life expectancies and health allows parents to provide for their children longer, but greater union dissolution among parents can weaken the safety net they can create for their adult children. Greater mortality, nonmarital childbearing, and divorce among families with lower socioeconomic status may be reinforcing inequalities across generations. This article examines two cohorts aged 25–49 from the 1988 (n = 7,246) and 2013 (n = 7,014) Panel Study of Income Dynamics Roster and Transfers Files. In 1988, adults with a college degree had two surviving parents living together for 1.8 years longer than nongraduates. This disparity increased to 6.8 years in 2013. This five-year increase in disparity was driven predominantly by higher rates of union dissolution among parents of adults with less education. Growing differences in paternal mortality also contributed to the rise in inequality.},

These questions are important because families have traditionally served as a vital private safety net for family members. Demographic changes increase family members’ uncertainty about their relationships. Family ties are less stable and more uncertain among the economically disadvantaged, and uncertainty may exacerbate these disadvantages by weakening individuals’ ability to rely on family members’ support to alleviate hardship. I argue that demographers should focus on individuals’ family relationships to gain insight into living arrangements and family dynamics. I also outline the development of family concepts and improvements in study design to identify principles that demographers should incorporate in new research to shed light on families’ support for their members.},

            Unstable couple relationships and high rates of repartnering have increased the share of U.S. families with stepkin. Yet data on stepfamily structure are from earlier periods, include only coresident stepkin, or cover only older adults. In this study, we use new data on family structure and transfers in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics ({PSID}) to describe the prevalence and numbers of stepparents and stepchildren for adults of all ages and to characterize the relationship between having stepkin and transfers of time and money between generations, regardless of whether the kin live together. We find that having stepparents and stepchildren is very common among U.S. households, especially younger households. Furthermore, stepkin substantially increase the typical household’s family size; stepparents and stepchildren increase a household’s number of parents and adult children by nearly 40 \% for married/cohabiting couples with living parents and children. However, having stepkin is associated with fewer transfers, particularly time transfers between married women and their stepparents and stepchildren. The increase in the number of family members due to stepkin is insufficient to compensate for the lower likelihood of transfers in stepfamilies. Our findings suggest that recent cohorts with more stepkin may give less time assistance to adult children and receive less time assistance from children in old age than prior generations.},

To provide an empirical basis for speculation about the implications of projected increases in single-person and couple-only households, we use two sources of data to describe relationships between family structure and the physical and emotional well-being of Japanese men and women age 60 and above. We find that marriage is positively associated with self-rated health and emotional well-being among older men but not women. In contrast to expectations, however, we find only limited evidence that the presence of children contributes to well-being. Taken as a whole, our results suggest that declines in marriage may have negative implications for the well-being of older Japanese men while the implications of declines in fertility and intergenerational coresidence may be less than popularly believed.},

We focus on three kin types: partner/spouse, children, and siblings. We find that differences in empirical estimates across measures of family structure are not dramatic, but that family embeddedness can show some additional heterogeneity in mortality patterns over family status variables or the volume of ties.

	abstract = {Purpose of the Study:
We compare the close family resources of Baby Boomers ({BBs}) to previous cohorts of older adults at population level and then examine individual-level cohort comparisons of age-related trajectories of informal care availability from midlife into old age.

Design and Methods:
Population data from the U.S. Census and from the Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}) are used to identify a cohort similar to the {BBs} on marital status and fertility rates. Using generalized linear mixed models and 10-year longitudinal data from Depression and {WWII} parents ({DWP}; n = 1,052) and the parents of {BBs} ({PBB}; n = 3,573) in the {HRS}, we examine cohort differences in the time-varying likelihoods of being married and of having an adult child living within 10 miles.

Results:
The {DWP} had similar informal care resources at entry to old age as is expected in the {BB}. Longitudinal analyses of the {DWP} and {PBB} cohorts in {HRS} reveal that the availability of family changes over time and that the {DWP} cohort was significantly less likely to have a spouse or a grown child living nearby.

Implications:
These findings, and future projections based on them, have significant implications for institutions and public policy concerned with the informal caregiving needs of the Boomer cohort as they age.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The first and second demographic transitions have led to profound changes in family networks. However, the timing and extent of these transitions vary widely across contexts. We examine how common it is for contemporary older adults to lack living kin and whether such individuals are uniformly disadvantaged around the world.

Methods
Using surveys from 34 countries that together contain 69.6\% of the world’s population over age 50 and come from all regions of the world, we describe the prevalence and correlates of lacking immediate kin. We examine macro-level demographic indicators associated with the prevalence of kinlessness as well as micro-level associations between kinlessness and sociodemographic and health indicators.

Results
There is great variation in levels of kinlessness, from over 10\% with neither a spouse nor a biological child in Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland to levels below 2\% in China and the Republic of Korea. There are strong macro-level relationships between kinlessness and lagged or contemporaneous fertility, mortality, and nuptiality measures and more marginal relationships with other demographic forces. Micro-level associations between kinlessness and respondent attributes are varied. The kinless are more likely to live alone than those with kin in all countries. In most countries, they have equivalent or worse self-rated health and lower education, although there are notable exceptions. There is substantial variation in the gender composition of the kinless population.

Discussion
As demographic changes affecting kinlessness continue, we expect the scale of the kinless population to grow around the world.},

Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or a er pruning some observations, {PSM} approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data.

We find that this data suggests several new facts that should be useful for researchers trying to model fertility. (1) The reduction in fertility known as the Demographic Transition (or the Fertility Transition) seems to be much sharper based on cohort fertility measures compared to usual measures like Total Fertility Rate; (2) The baby boom was not quite as large as is suggested by some previous work; (3) We find a strong negative relationship between income and fertility for all cohorts and estimate an overall income elasticity of about -0.38 for the period; (4) We also find systematic deviations from a time invariant, isoelastic, relationship between income and fertility. The most interesting of these is an increase in the income elasticity of demand for children for the 1876-1880 to 1906-1910 birth cohorts. This implies an increased spread in fertility by income which was followed by a dramatic compression.},

	abstract = {The traditional view of cities as monocentric conglomerates of people clustered around an employment center, driving economic growth in cities that subsequently trickles down to the hinterland, is increasingly being challenged. In particular, the role of space, technological leadership, human capital, increasing returns to scale and industrial clustering as well as hierarchical organization principles have been emphasized in the more recent literature. This paper utilizes exploratory and spatial econometric data analysis techniques to investigate these issues for {US} counties using data from 1969 through 2003. Ultimately, contiguous and hierarchical organization and interaction patterns are captured using an endogenous growth model allowing for spatial effects, inspired by earlier work on human capital and technology gaps. We investigate a neoclassical growth model and compare it to a spatial version of an endogenous growth model allowing for “domestic” investment in human capital and catch-up to the technology leader, and find that human capital strongly contributes to growth in a neoclassical setting, but much less so in an endogenous setting. In the endogenous model the catch-up term dominates in comparison to “domestic” human capital effects.},

While an increasing number of projections exist, those carried out at relatively high resolution that account for subnational heterogeneity and can be tailored to represent alternative scenarios of future development are rare. We draw on state-level population projections for the {US} and a gravity-style spatial downscaling model to design and produce new spatial projections for the U.S. at 1 km resolution consistent with a subset of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSPs}), scenarios of societal change widely used in integrated analyses of global and regional change. We ﬁnd that the projections successfully capture intended alternative development patterns described in the {SSPs}, from sprawl to concentrated development and mixed outcomes. Our projected spatial patterns diﬀer more strongly across scenarios than in existing projections, capturing a wider range of the relevant uncertainty introduced by the distinct scenarios. These projections provide an improved basis for integrated environmental analysis that considers uncertainty in demographic outcomes.},

	abstract = {This study discusses fertility trends and variation in countries that completed the transition from high to around-replacement fertility in the 1950s to 1980s, especially in Europe, East Asia and North America, and summarizes the key relevant ﬁndings for those countries with a more recent experience of fertility decline towards replacement level. A central ﬁnding is that there is no obvious theoretical or empirical threshold around which period fertility tends to stabilize. Period fertility rates usually continue falling once the threshold of replacement fertility is crossed, often to very low levels. While cohort fertility rates frequently stabilize or change gradually, period fertility typically remains unstable. This instability also includes marked upturns and reversals in Total Fertility Rates ({TFRs}), as experienced in many countries in Europe in the early 2000s. The long-lasting trend towards delayed parenthood is central for understanding diverse, low and unstable post-transitional fertility patterns. In many countries in Europe this shift to a late childbearing pattern has negatively affected the {TFR} for more than four decades. Many emerging post-transitional countries and regions are likely to experience a similar shift over the next two to three decades, with a depression of their {TFRs} to very low levels.},

We argue that the postponement–low fertility nexus noted in demographic and biomedical research is especially relevant for women who pursue postgraduate education because of the potential overlap of education completion, early career stages, and family formation. The results show that women with postgraduate education differ from women with college education in terms of the timing of the first birth, childlessness, and completed fertility. While the postponement trend, which began with the cohorts born in the 1940s, has continued among highly educated women in the {USA}, its associations with childlessness and completed parity have changed considerably over subsequent cohorts. We delineate five distinct postponement phases over the 80-year observation window, consistent with variation over time in the prevalence of strategies for combining tertiary education and employment with family formation.},

In addition, demographers demonstrated during the decade that trends such as marriage and divorce were diverging according to education. Moreover, demographic trends in the age structure of the population showed that a large increase in the elderly population will occur in the 2010s. Overall, demographic trends produced an increased complexity of family life and a more ambiguous and fluid set of categories than demographers are accustomed to measuring.},

We refute the statistical basis of fertility rising with improving human development ({HDI}) or any other such general composite index. Instead we show that the bottlenecks are much more specific and are due to particular mixes of factors in the various countries. We predict the continuation of structural below replacement fertility for the second decade of the 21st Century in Europe. German-speaking countries could escape from the low fertility trap if they adjust their child-care and school organization, but for southern and formerly Communist countries ({FCCs}), that escape will be more difficult given the existence of multiple disadvantages.},

The overall reduction in the birth rate reflects declines across many groups of women, including teens, Hispanic women, and college-educated white women. The Great Recession contributed to the decline in the early part of this period, but we are unable to identify any other economic, policy, or social factor that has changed since 2007 that is responsible for much of the decline beyond that. Mechanically, the falling birth rate can be attributed to changes in birth patterns across recent cohorts of women moving through childbearing age. We conjecture that the “shifting priorities” of more recent cohorts, reflecting changes in preferences for having children, aspirations for life, and parenting norms, may be responsible. We conclude with a brief discussion about the societal consequences for a declining birth rate and what the United States might do about it.},

	abstract = {In every developed country, the economic transition from pre-industrial stagnation to modern growth was accompanied by a demographic transition from high to low fertility. Even though the overall pattern is repeated, there are large cross-country variations in the timing and speed of the demographic transition. What accounts for falling fertility during the transition to growth? To answer this question, this paper develops a uni®ed growth model that delivers a transition from stagnation to growth, accompanied by declining fertility. The model is used to determine whether government policies that affect the opportunity cost of education can account for crosscountry variations in fertility decline. Among the policies considered, education subsidies are found to have only minor effects, while accounting for child labor regulation is crucial. Apart from in¯uencing fertility, the policies also determine the evolution of the income distribution in the course of development.},

            Between 1990 and 2002, the age pattern of Type I first-birth rates (i.e., the hazard of a first birth) among U.S. women was bimodal. This pattern, driven by changing differential fertility patterns among racial and ethnic groups, reached its apex at the mid-1990s and had almost vanished by the decade’s end. Research on first-birth timing has tended to focus on Type {II} first-birth rates and therefore has failed to identify this larger, bimodal pattern. This article presents the benefits of using Type I rates, documents the emergence of the bimodal pattern via two new measures of bimodality, and uses a decomposition analysis to discuss the pattern’s causes.},

We find little effect of job losses on the white teen birthrate. For black teens, however, job losses to 1 \% of the working-age population decrease the birthrate by around 2 \%. Birth declines start five months after the job loss and then last for more than one year. Linking the timing of job losses and conceptions suggests that black teen births decline because of increased terminations and perhaps also because of changes in prepregnancy behaviors. National data on risk behaviors also provide evidence that black teens reduce sexual activity and increase contraception use in response to job losses. Job losses seven to nine months after conception do not affect teen birthrates, indicating that teens do not anticipate job losses and lending confidence that job losses are “shocks” that can be viewed as quasi-experimental variation. We also find evidence that relatively advantaged black teens disproportionately abort after job losses, implying that the average child born to a black teen in the wake of job loss is relatively more disadvantaged.},

Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth outside of marriage. Recent theoretical and qualitative work at the intersection of demography and cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high, nearly unattainable, economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions. We use the events of the Great Recession, leveraging variation in the severity of the crisis between years and across states, to examine how exposure to worse state-level economic conditions is related to poor women’s likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012. In accord with theory, we find that women of low socioeconomic status ({SES}) exposed to worse economic conditions are indeed somewhat less likely to marry. However, we also find that unmarried low-{SES} women exposed to worse economic conditions significantly reduce their fertility; economic standing is not disconnected from nonmarital fertility. Our results suggest that economic concerns were connected to fertility decisions for low-{SES} unmarried women during the Great Recession.},

We focus on variations by partnership and marital status. Overall, we ﬁnd that worse economic conditions were predictive of a lower risk of unplanned pregnancy. Women’s odds of intended pregnancy did not, however, respond uniformly to economic conditions but varied by marital status. When economic conditions were poor, married women had lower odds of intended pregnancy, whereas cohabiting women had greater odds of intended pregnancy.},

First, we describe the origin of this framework and its evolution over time. Second, we review the empirical ﬁt of the framework to major changes in demographic and family behavior in the United States, the West, and beyond. As has been the case for other unilinear, developmental theories of demographic or family change, the {SDT} failed to predict many contemporary patterns of change and difference.

To do so, the differential effects of local and regional unemployment on the likelihood that individual women and men are unemployed and differences in the underlying patterns of unemployment by gender are explored. Using a unique tabulation of micro data for labor market areas, two series of multilevel models for women and men are fit. The multilevel model results suggest that regional variation in unemployment is more evident for men than for women and, contrary to the empirical evidence, the underlying pattern of unemployment for men is more clustered than for women. The article concludes by discussing the policy implications of the finding that most of the variation in labor market outcomes for both women and men is attributable to individual-level rather than labor market area-level characteristics.},

The upper branch consists of countries in Northern and Western Europe, Oceania and the United States; the lower branch includes Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, and East and Southeast Asia. A review of the major theories for low fertility countries reveals that none of them would have predicted this specific bifurcation. We argue that those countries with fertility levels close to replacement level have institutional arrangements, and related policies, that make it easier, not easy, for women to combine the worker and mother roles. The institutional details are quite different across countries, suggesting that multiple combinations of institutional arrangements and policies can lead to the same country-level fertility outcome. Canada, the only exception to this bifurcation, illustrates the importance of the different institutional structures in Québec compared to the rest of Canada.},

	abstract = {Occupations are central to the stratification systems of industrial countries, but they have played little role in empirical attempts to explain the well-documented increase in wage inequality that occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. We address this deficiency by assessing occupation-level effects on wage inequality using data from the Current Population Survey for 1983 through 2008. We model the mean and variance of wages for each occupation, controlling for education and demographic factors at the individual level to test three competing explanations for the increase in wage inequality: (1) the growth of between-occupation polarization, (2) changes in education and labor force composition, and (3) residual inequality unaccounted for by occupations and demographic characteristics. After correcting for a problem with imputed data that biased Kim and Sakamoto’s (2008) results, we find that betweenoccupation changes explain 66 percent of the increase in wage inequality from 1992 to 2008, although 23 percent of this is due to the switch to the 2000 occupation codes in 2003. Sensitivity analysis reveals that 18 percent of the increase in inequality from 1983 to 2002 is due to changes in just three occupations: managers ‘‘not elsewhere classified,’’ secretaries, and computer systems analysts.},

We refute the statistical basis of fertility rising with improving human development ({HDI}) or any other such general composite index. Instead we show that the bottlenecks are much more specific and are due to particular mixes of factors in the various countries. We predict the continuation of structural below replacement fertility for the second decade of the 21st Century in Europe. German-speaking countries could escape from the low fertility trap if they adjust their child-care and school organization, but for southern and formerly Communist countries ({FCCs}), that escape will be more difficult given the existence of multiple disadvantages.},

            Trade union institutions are historically and comparatively weak in the United States, and union membership has been in steady decline over several decades. Scholars thus question the contemporary relevance of organized labor to social policy. Yet, there is considerable state-level variation in social policy and union institutional strength that remains underexamined. Focusing on variability across {US} states, this paper uses mixed-methods analysis to examine relationships between organized labor and parental and family leave legislation under varying political conditions. Event history analysis of state-level leave policy adoption from 1983 to 2016 shows that union institutional strength, particularly in the public sector, is positively associated with the timing of leave policy adoption. These findings are robust to the inclusion of other factors, including Democratic control of state houses, which is also shown to facilitate leave policy adoption. Comparative case studies support event history findings and illustrate how state house partisanship informs the level of government that leave advocates target for policy change. The paper concludes by suggesting further attention to subnational policies and investigation into the social movement practice of target-shifting and its effects. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the operation of power resources at the subnational level within a liberal market national context.},

This question is key to the discussion whether or not governments should take action aimed at influencing the fertility rate. To enhance the scholarly discussion in this field, the paper introduces a clearly defined hypothesis which describes plausible self-reinforcing mechanisms that would result, if unchecked, in a continued decrease of the number of births in the countries affected. This hypothesis has three components: a demographic one based on the negative population growth momentum, i.e., the fact that fewer potential mothers in the future will result in fewer births; a sociological one based on the assumption that ideal family size for the younger cohorts is declining as a consequence of the lower actual fertility they see in previous cohorts; and an economic one based on the first part of Easterlin’s (1980) relative income hypothesis, namely, that fertility results from the combination of aspirations and expected income, and assuming that aspirations of young adults are on an increasing trajectory while the expected income for the younger cohorts declines, partly as a consequence of population ageing induced by low fertility. All three factors would work towards a downward spiral in births in the future. If there is reason to assume that such mechanisms will indeed be at work, then this should strengthen the motivation of governments to take immediate action (possibly through policies addressing the tempo effect) in order to still escape from the expected trap.},

The two countries offer largely similar family policies, but differ concerning family policy context. While Sweden has a consistent policy concerning gender relations, Norway has more ambiguous family policies giving incentives both to gender equality and childrearing at home. Our study is based on event-history analyses of Nordic register data and shows that fathers’ parental leave use is positively associated with continued childbearing in both Norway and Sweden, for both one- and two-child couples. The association is stronger in Norway. For two-child families, a long period of leave for the mother is positively associated with a third birth. It seems as if the two-child family is highly compatible with the combination of work and family life, but that in families who choose to have more children, the mother often seems to have a weaker work orientation.},

            Many scholars have offered structural and ideational explanations for the fertility changes occurring around the world. This paper focuses on the influence of developmental idealism—a schema or set of beliefs endorsing development, fertility change, and causal connections between development and fertility. Developmental idealism is argued to be an important force affecting both population policy and the fertility behavior of ordinary people. We present new survey data from ordinary people in six countries—Argentina, China, Egypt, Iran, Nepal, and the United States—about the extent to which developmental idealism is known and believed. We ask individuals if they believe that fertility and development are correlated, that development is a causal force in changing fertility levels, and that fertility declines enhance the standard of living and intergenerational relations. We also ask people about their expectations concerning future trends in fertility in their countries and whether they approve or disapprove of the trends they expect. The data show widespread linkage in the minds of ordinary people between fertility and development. Large fractions of people in these six settings believe that fertility and development are correlated, that development reduces fertility, and that declines in fertility foster development. Many also expect and endorse future declines in fertility.},

First, we point out that in the early stages of development, fertility and schooling may rise together as the schooling of younger children increases their relative contribution to family income when they turn working age. Second, the model contains a supply-side theory of schooling that generates a rise in schooling independent of technological change. Third, we introduce a direct negative effect of industrialization on fertility that does not operate through human capital and the quantity-quality tradeoff. An initial quantitative assessment of the theoretical mechanisms is conducted by calibrating and applying the model to United States history from 1800 to 2000. We ﬁnd that the demise in family production is an important factor reducing fertility in the 19th century and schooling of older children is dominant factor reducing fertility in the 20th century. The same model is applied to England from 1740 to 1940, where we offer two complimentary explanations for the rise in fertility from 1740 to 1820. The ﬁrst is based on the rapid expansion in the cottage industry and the second on the increased relative productivity of children. We also ﬁnd that the subsequent fall in fertility from 1820 to 1940 cannot be explained without introducing child labor/compulsory schooling laws.},

This has, in turn, given rise to a massive transformation in traditional cross-national patterns of relationships between fertility and other variables. Whereas previously the countries with the highest period fertility rates were those in which family-oriented cultural traditions were most pronounced and in which women’s labour market participation was least, these relationships are now wholly reversed. This study uses data for 21 {OECD} countries to provide a more thorough and systematic mapping of the linkages between fertility, cultural values, economic structure and social policy than has hitherto been attempted in the literature, while simultaneously addressing some of the theoretical and methodological issues that arise in explaining a reversal of this magnitude. It argues that seemingly anomalous linkages with cultural traditions and employment structure are consequences of women’s changing work and family preferences and of cross-national differences in the adoption of family-friendly public policy.},

	abstract = {The educational gradient in life expectancy is well documented in the United States and in other low-mortality countries. Highly educated Americans, on average, live longer than their low-educated counterparts, who have recently seen declines in adult life expectancy. However, limiting the discussion on lifespan inequality to mean differences alone overlooks other dimensions of inequality and particularly disparities in lifespan variation. The latter represents a unique form of inequality, with higher variation translating into greater uncertainty in the time of death from an individual standpoint, and higher group heterogeneity from a population perspective. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System from 1990 to 2010, this is the first study to document trends in both life expectancy and S25—the standard deviation of age at death above 25—by educational attainment. Among low-educated whites, adult life expectancy declined by 3.1 years for women and by 0.6 years for men. At the same time, S25 increased by about 1.5 years among high school–educated whites of both genders, becoming an increasingly important component of total lifespan inequality. By contrast, college-educated whites benefited from rising life expectancy and record low variation in age at death, consistent with the shifting mortality scenario. Among blacks, adult life expectancy increased, and S25 plateaued or declined in nearly all educational attainment groups, although blacks generally lagged behind whites of the same gender on both measures. Documenting trends in lifespan variation can therefore improve our understanding of lifespan inequality and point to diverging trajectories in adult mortality across socioeconomic strata.},

A central finding is that there is no obvious theoretical or empirical threshold around which period fertility would tend to stabilise. Period fertility rates usually continue falling once the threshold of replacement fertility is crossed, often to very low levels. While cohort fertility rates frequently stabilise or change gradually, period fertility typically remains unstable. This instability also includes remarkable upturns and reversals in Total Fertility Rates ({TFR}), as experienced in many countries in Europe in the early 2000s. The long-lasting trend towards delayed parenthood is central for understanding the diverse, low and unstable post-transitional fertility patterns. In many countries in Europe this shift to a late childbearing pattern has negatively affected the {TFR} for more than four decades. Many of the emerging post-transitional countries and regions are likely to experience a similar shift during the next two to three decades, often depressing their {TFRs} to very low levels.},

	abstract = {Background—The incidence of unintended pregnancy is among the most essential health status indicators in the field of reproductive health. One ongoing goal of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is to reduce unintended pregnancy, but the national rate has not been estimated since 2001. Study Design—We combined data on women’s pregnancy intentions from the 2006—08 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}) with a 2008 national survey of abortion patients, data on births from the National Center for Health Statistics, induced abortions from a national abortion provider census, miscarriages estimated from the {NSFG}, and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Results—Nearly half (49\%) of pregnancies were unintended in 2006, up slightly from 2001 (48\%). The unintended pregnancy rate increased to 52 per 1,000 women aged 15—44 years old in 2006, from 50 in 2001. Disparities in unintended pregnancy rates among subgroups persisted, and women who were 18—24 years old, poor, or cohabiting had rates two to three times that of the national rate. The unintended pregnancy rate declined notably for teens 15—17 years old. The proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion decreased from 47\% in 2001 to 43\% in 2006, and the unintended birth rate increased from 23 to 25 per 1,000 women 15—44 years old.
Conclusions—Since 2001, the U.S. has not made progress reducing unintended pregnancy. Rates increased for nearly all groups and remain high overall. Efforts to help women and couples plan their pregnancies, such as increasing access to effective contraceptives, should target groups at greatest risk of unintended pregnancy, particularly poor and cohabiting women.},

	abstract = {During the 2010s, fertility rates fell across the Nordic region. The onset of these declines seems linked to the Great Recession of 2008–2009, but their continuation cannot easily be linked to subsequent economic change. The 1990s, too, brought episodes of economic crises to the Nordic region that were followed by different degrees of fertility decline. In this study, we provide an empirical overview of parity-, age- and education-specific fertility developments in the five Nordic countries in the wake of the economic recessions in 2008 and the early 1990s, respectively. We demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity in fertility developments across countries after 1990, whereas after 2008, the trends are much more similar across the five countries. Likewise, the educational differences in birth hazards that characterized the developments after 1990 were much smaller in the initial years after 2008–2009. This reversal from heterogeneity to homogeneity in the fertility response to recessions calls for an expansion of theories on the cyclicality of fertility in relation to uncertainty and economic and social change. In our discussion, we consider the role of a set of factors that also incorporates the state, crisis management, and perceptions of economic and welfare uncertainty.},

Despite continued theoretical attention to this issue by demographers, empirical research integrating gender roles and equity in relation to fertility remains surprisingly sparse. This paper first provides a brief review of previous research that has examined gender roles and fertility followed by a comparison of six prominent gender equality indices: Gender-related Development Index ({GDI}), Gender Empowerment Measure ({GEM}), Gender Gap Index ({GGI}), Gender Equality Index ({GEI}), the European Union Gender Equality Index ({EU}-{GEI}) and the Social Institutions and Gender Index ({SIGI}). The paper then tests how five of these indices impact fertility intentions and behaviour using a series of multilevel (random-coefficient) logistic regression models, applying the European Social Survey (2004/5). The {GDI}, with its emphasis on human development, adjusted for gender, has the strongest and significant effect on fertility intentions. The {EU}-{GEI}, which focuses on the universal caregiver model, uncovers that more equity significantly lowers fertility intentions, but only for women. The remaining indicators show no significant impact. The paper concludes with a reflection and suggestions for future research.},

In this paper I review how four drivers of inequality mediate the childbearing behavior of women of diﬀerent educational backgrounds: ﬁrst, the impact of rising employment polarization; second, the slowdown in gender convergence in labor participation and wages since the late 1990s; third, the fertility behavior of newly-arrived immigrants contingent on economic opportunities in destination countries; and fourth, widening gaps in resources children receive from parents with diﬀerent levels of educational attainment. These gaps can have lasting intergenerational impact both in economic and social outcomes such as fertility and union formation.},

We ﬁnd that the strong negative correlation between {GDP} per capita does no longer hold for high levels of per capita economic output; the relation and fertility instead seems to turn into positive from a certain threshold level of economic development on. Survival of an inverse J-shaped association between {GDP} per capita and fertility is found when controlling for birth postponement, omitted variable bias, non-stationarity and endogeneity. However, gaps between actual and predicted fertility rates show implicitly the importance of factors inﬂuencing fertility above and over per capita income. By decomposing {GDP} per capita into several components, we identify female employment as co-varying factor for the fertility rebound that can be observed in several highly developed countries. Pointing out to important differences with regard to the compatibility between childbearing and female employment, our results suggest that fertility increases are likely to be small if economic development is not accompanied by institutional changes that improve parents’ opportunities to combine work and family life.},

Within the developed world, “first-wave developers”—or countries that began socioeconomic development in the 19th/early 20th century – currently have much higher fertility levels than “late developers”. We lay out a novel theoretical approach to explain why this is the case and provide empirical evidence to support our argument. Our approach not only explains historical periods of low fertility but also sheds light on why there exists such large variance in fertility rates among today’s developed countries.},

With rare exceptions, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant relationships between family support environment indicators and second or higher order births. In contrast, the relationship between family support environment indicators and ﬁrst births is weaker and less often signiﬁcant. This pattern accords with theory that practical considerations are more important for the second and subsequent births than for the transition to parenthood. Although most forms of support are positively related to fertility, we document a negative relationship between intergenerational exchange of support and higher order fertility. Our analyses also reveal that macro-level support environments are related to childbearing plans in much the same way as they are related to having a child, buttressing the argument that understanding the determinants of childbearing plans can help us to understand childbearing behavior.},

The analyses were conducted separately for urban, suburban and rural counties. According to the multivariate results, a negative association between selected human development indicators and {TFR} exists in suburban and rural counties, as well as in the United States as a whole. However, this is not the case for urban counties, where the results were inconclusive. Some indicators (e.g., median income per capita) were found to be positively, and some (e.g., the share of adults with at least bachelor’s degree) negatively, associated with {TFR} in urban counties. All in all, our results provide evidence of a negative relationship between human development indicators and period fertility in the United States at the county level, a ﬁnding which is consistent with the basic tenets of classic demographic transition theory.},

Our main findings consist of two parts. First, contrary to the expectations of scholars who emphasize the lack of gender/feminist consciousness in Eastern Europe, we argue that gender indeed is an important determinant of gender role opinions in post-communist societies: as elsewhere women express more liberal attitudes than men. Second, we argue that the interaction of other determinants of gender role opinions with gender also follows patterns described in the literature for more developed capitalist countries. In this respect, therefore, East European countries seem to fit the general trends of gender role opinion formation. As explanation we point to a connection between women’s material conditions and their gender role attitudes, not denying the importance of cultural difference – if primarily as exception – to this process.},

Spatial projections of population must account for changes in aggregate population, urbanization, and spatial patterns of development, while accounting for uncertainty in each. While an increasing number of projections exist, those carried out at relatively high resolution that account for subnational heterogeneity and can be tailored to represent alternative scenarios of future development are rare. We draw on state-level population projections for the {US} and a gravity-style spatial downscaling model to design and produce new spatial projections for the U.S. at 1 km resolution consistent with a subset of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSPs}), scenarios of societal change widely used in integrated analyses of global and regional change. We ﬁnd that the projections successfully capture intended alternative development patterns described in the {SSPs}, from sprawl to concentrated development and mixed outcomes. Our projected spatial patterns diﬀer more strongly across scenarios than in existing projections, capturing a wider range of the relevant uncertainty introduced by the distinct scenarios. These projections provide an improved basis for integrated environmental analysis that considers uncertainty in demographic outcomes.},

            Low fertility levels and later childbearing in many developed countries have reinvigorated the debate between period and cohort perspectives on fertility and on the meaningfulness of the period total fertility rate ({TFR}). Here, fertility-timing effects are defined as level changes in period fertility that do not reflect level changes in the completed fertility of cohorts. That definition leads to the average cohort fertility ({ACF}) as a measure of period fertility adjusted for timing effects. In an influential paper, Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) presented an alternative approach and a different measure, {TFR}*, to adjust for timing effects. Here, the two measures are compared. In the context of model populations, the {ACF} performs well, reflecting an average of the fertility of the active cohorts. The Bongaarts-Feeney {TFR}*, however, is frequently unreliable and can be erratic when there are cycles in period timing. When applied to twentieth-century U.S. experience, the {TFR}* behaves like a period measure and yields adjustments that are often wide of the mark. The {ACF} shows the stability associated with cohort measures and quantifies the substantial impact that timing effects had during the “birth dearth” of the 1970s. The period {TFR} reached a low of 1.74 in 1976, but the {ACF} never went below 2.06 during the 1970s.},

	abstract = {In this chapter we revisit the relationship between income and fertility. There is overwhelming empirical evidence that fertility is negatively related to income in most countries at most times. Several theories have been proposed in the literature to explain this somewhat puzzling fact. The most common one is based on the opportunity cost of time being higher for individuals with higher earnings. Alternatively, people might differ in their desire to procreate and accordingly some people invest more in children and less in market-specific human capital and thus have lower earnings. We revisit these and other possible explanations. We find that these theories are not as robust as is commonly believed. That is, several special assumptions are needed to generate the negative relationship. Not all assumptions are equally plausible. Such findings will be useful to distinguish alternative theories. We conclude that further research along these lines is needed.},

The method reduces the computational burden of estimating such models. We show the valuation functions characterizing the expected future utility associated with the choices often can be represented as an easily computed function of the state variables, structural parameters, and the probabilities of choosing alternative actions for states which are feasible in the future. Under certain conditions, nonparametric estimators of these probabilities can be formed from sample information on the relative frequencies of observed choices using observations with the same (or similar) state variables. Substituting the estimators for the true conditional choice probabilities in formulating optimal decision rules, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting structural parameter estimators. To illustrate our new method, we estimate a dynamic model of parental contraceptive choice and fertility using data from the National Fertility Survey.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates semiparametric reduced-form neoclassical models of life-cycle fertility in Sweden. Rising female wages delay times to all conceptions and reduce total conceptions. This result is robust across a variety of empirical specifications. In the best fitting models in which marital status is excluded, male incomes--defined to be zero for unmarried women without a cohabiting male partner--reduce times to conceptions and increase total conceptions. The results on female wages are robust across a variety of empirical specifications, but those on male incomes are not robust to the introduction of marital status and cohabitational status variables, even though models with such variables can be rejected by our model specification tests. We find a particular neoclassical model that predicts fertility attained at different ages as well as the aggregate time series of birth rates. A model that excludes wages and incomes predicts fertility attained at different ages but fails to predict the aggregate time series and is dominated by the neoclassical model in terms of non-nested test criteria. Cohort drift found in estimated parameters is consistent with the expansion of pronatal social programs. The estimated neoclassical model produces strong short-run responses of birth rates to wages and incomes of the sort that have been found in the time-series literature on fertility while generating the relatively weak long-run responses to economic variables found in the cross-sectional literature on completed fertility.},

Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth outside of marriage. Recent theoretical and qualitative work at the intersection of demography and cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high, nearly unattainable, economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions. We use the events of the Great Recession, leveraging variation in the severity of the crisis between years and across states, to examine how exposure to worse state-level economic conditions is related to poor women's likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012. In accord with theory, we find that women of low socioeconomic status ({SES}) exposed to worse economic conditions are indeed somewhat less likely to marry. However, we also find that unmarried low-{SES} women exposed to worse economic conditions significantly reduce their fertility; economic standing is not disconnected from nonmarital fertility. Our results suggest that economic concerns were connected to fertility decisions for low-{SES} unmarried women during the Great Recession.},

Background Childless men account for more than a third of adult men in the United States, but it is unclear if they desire to become fathers, and if not, whether this sentiment changed over time. Method Time trends for multiple measures of expectations for and attitudes toward fatherhood are plotted using samples of childless men from the National Survey of Family Growth, the Monitoring the Future study, and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Transition to Adulthood supplement. Results Across the time series, a growing share of childless men do not want children and increasingly, a lack of children would not bother them at all. Additionally, certainty in having children among childless men has waned over time and fewer childless men are concerned with parental leave policies when evaluating their job options. Conclusion Across the first two decades of the 2000s, there is an increasing disinterest in becoming fathers among childless men. These trends have broad implications for family researchers who study fertility rates, men's health, and family relationships.},

We find that this data suggests several new facts that should be useful for researchers trying to model fertility. (1) The reduction in fertility known as the Demographic Transition (or the Fertility Transition) seems to be much sharper based on cohort fertility measures compared to usual measures like Total Fertility Rate; (2) The baby boom was not quite as large as is suggested by some previous work; (3) We find a strong negative relationship between income and fertility for all cohorts and estimate an overall income elasticity of about -0.38 for the period; (4) We also find systematic deviations from a time invariant, isoelastic, relationship between income and fertility. The most interesting of these is an increase in the income elasticity of demand for children for the 1876-1880 to 1906-1910 birth cohorts. This implies an increased spread in fertility by income which was followed by a dramatic compression.},

Our contributions are both theoretical and empirical. We ﬁrst discuss important trends which might foster the emergence of a positive fertility–development relationship across regions of highly developed countries. These include shifts in family policies, changes in the spatial organisation of the economic sphere, and selective international and internal migration processes. In order to explore whether we observe tendencies towards a reversal, we investigate data covering 20 European countries subdivided in 256 regions between 1990 and 2012. We document a weakening of the negative relationship between fertility and economic development within many countries, and among some countries the emergence of a positive relationship. These ﬁndings do not seem to be driven by postponement effects alone. However, there is substantial variation in the fertility and the economic development levels at which such tendencies towards a reversal are observed.},

We revisit this assumption by studying reuniﬁed Germany, a country that did not follow a strict modernization pathway.

Based on nationally representative, pooled cross-sectional data from the German General Social Survey ({ALLBUS}) from 1991 to 2016, we apply variance function regression to examine the impact of German reuniﬁcation—akin to a natural experiment—on the average levels and dispersion of gender ideology. The results show: (i) East German cohorts socialized after reuniﬁcation hold less egalitarian ideologies than cohorts socialized in the {GDR}, disrupting the rising tide. (ii) East German cohorts hold more egalitarian ideologies than West German cohorts, but the East-West gap is less pronounced for post-reuniﬁcation cohorts. (iii) Cohorts in East Germany show higher conformity with gender ideology than their counterparts in West Germany; yet conformity did not change after reuniﬁcation.

While the limitation of fecundity from aging is obvious for women, the diminishing capability of men to reproduce in later ages is still poorly measured and infrequently discussed. When evaluating the fecundity of couples, maternal age is the most important confounding factor and it can hardly be overcome unless a sufficient age difference between spouses is present. While some assisted reproduction-based studies have found no significant effect of paternal age on fecundability, a growing body of literature suggests a decline starting as soon as age 40. However, little is known about the exact shape of the declining trend of male fecundity. Moreover, current medical research on the subject faces many methodological obstacles and a scarcity of appropriate population samples.},

This question is key to the discussion whether or not governments should take action aimed at influencing the fertility rate. To enhance the scholarly discussion in this field, the paper introduces a clearly defined hypothesis which describes plausible self-reinforcing mechanisms that would result, if unchecked, in a continued decrease of the number of births in the countries affected. This hypothesis has three components: a demographic one based on the negative population growth momentum, i.e., the fact that fewer potential mothers in the future will result in fewer births; a sociological one based on the assumption that ideal family size for the younger cohorts is declining as a consequence of the lower actual fertility they see in previous cohorts; and an economic one based on the first part of Easterlin's (1980) relative income hypothesis, namely, that fertility results from the combination of aspirations and expected income, and assuming that aspirations of young adults are on an increasing trajectory while the expected income for the younger cohorts declines, partly as a consequence of population ageing induced by low fertility. All three factors would work towards a downward spiral in births in the future. If there is reason to assume that such mechanisms will indeed be at work, then this should strengthen the motivation of governments to take immediate action (possibly through policies addressing the tempo effect) in order to still escape from the expected trap.},

The analyses were conducted separately for urban, suburban and rural counties. According to the multivariate results, a negative association between selected human development indicators and {TFR} exists in suburban and rural counties, as well as in the United States as a whole. However, this is not the case for urban counties, where the results were inconclusive. Some indicators (e.g., median income per capita) were found to be positively, and some (e.g., the share of adults with at least bachelor’s degree) negatively, associated with {TFR} in urban counties. All in all, our results provide evidence of a negative relationship between human development indicators and period fertility in the United States at the county level, a finding which is consistent with the basic tenets of classic demographic transition theory.},

In this article, we show that the reversal in the {HDI}-{TFR} relationship is robust to neither the {UNDP}'s recent revision in the {HDI} calculation method nor the decomposition of the {HDI} into its education, standard-of-living, and health subindices.},

	abstract = {Recessions can alter family life by constraining the choices that individuals and couples make concerning their family lives and by activating the family?s role as an emergency support system. Both effects were visible during and after the Great Recession. Fertility declined by 9 to 11 percent, depending on the measure, and the decline was greater in states that experienced higher increases in unemployment. The decline was greater among younger women, which suggests postponement rather than forgoing of births. The fall in fertility was sharpest for Hispanics, a result the authors attribute to a drop in Mexican immigration, which reduced the number of recent immigrants, the group with the highest fertility. Substantial increases occurred in the percentage of young adults, single and married, who lived with their parents, augmenting a long-term trend toward intergenerational coresidence. There was a slight decline in divorce and separation in states with higher unemployment.},

We develop a theoretical argument about the emerging consequences of this stage of the gender revolution and review research results that bear on it. The argument compares the determinants and consequences of recent family trends in industrialized societies provided by two narratives: the {SDT} and the gender revolution in the public and private spheres. Our argument examines differences in theoretical foundations and positive vs. negative implications for the future. We focus primarily on the growing evidence for turnarounds in the relationships between measures of women's human capital and union formation, fertility, and union dissolution, and consider evidence that men's home involvement increases union formation and fertility and decreases union instability. Although the family trends underlying the {SDT} and the gender revolution narratives are ongoing and a convincing view of the phenomenon has not yet emerged, the wide range of recent research results documenting changing, even reversing relationships suggests that the gender approach is increasingly the more fruitful one.},

	abstract = {Between 1998 and 2008 European countries experienced the first continent-wide increase in the period total fertility rate ({TFR}) since the 1960s. After discussing period and cohort influences on fertility trends, we examine the role of tempo distortions of period fertility and different methods for removing them. We highlight the usefulness of a new indicator: the tempo- and parity-adjusted total fertility rate ({TFRp}*). This variant of the adjusted total fertility rate proposed by Bongaarts and Feeney also controls for the parity composition of the female population and provides more stable values than the indicators proposed in the past. Finally, we estimate levels and trends in tempo and parity distribution distortions in selected countries in Europe. Our analysis of period and cohort fertility indicators in the Czech Republic, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden shows that the new adjusted measure gives a remarkable fit with the completed fertility of women in prime childbearing years in a given period, which suggests that it provides an accurate adjustment for tempo and parity composition distortions. Using an expanded dataset for ten countries, we demonstrate that adjusted fertility as measured by {TFRp}* remained nearly stable since the late 1990s. This finding implies that the recent upturns in the period {TFR} in Europe are largely explained by a decline in the pace of fertility postponement. Other tempo-adjusted fertility indicators have not indicated such a large role for the diminishing tempo effect in these {TFR} upturns. As countries proceed through their postponement transitions, tempo effects will decline further and eventually disappear, thus putting continued upward pressure on period fertility. However, such an upward trend may be obscured for a few years by the effects of economic recession.},

Using two Eurobarometer survey data (2006 and 2011) on individuals clustered in the 27 {EU} countries, I investigate the relationship between women's education and lifetime fertility intentions. Results suggest that a positive association between women's level of education and lifetime fertility intentions exists at both the individual and country levels, as well as in a micro–macro integrated framework. The main explanation for these findings—which remains to be proven by future research—is that, in institutional contexts allowing highly educated women to have large families, women of reproductive ages are more prone to make investments in both human capital and family size, because these choices are not seen as incompatible alternatives.},

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 4,548), the authors estimated the effect of economic concerns on the probability of becoming pregnant in the next year. They exploited exogenous variation in economic concerns induced by the announcement of a major German unemployment benefit reform as an instrumental variable and found that strong economic concerns were significantly related to lower fertility of women between ages 26 and 44 years cohabiting with a male partner. Jointly estimating the impact of male and female concerns in a model that allows for endogeneity of perceived economic uncertainty revealed that it was strong economic concerns perceived by the women that reduced fertility. The effect was driven by male main breadwinner couples, by couples with a medium household income, and by couples who already had children.},

	abstract = {Measuring and forecasting migration patterns has important implications for understanding broader population trends, for designing policy effectively and for allocating resources. However, data on migration and mobility are often lacking, and those that do exist are not available in a timely manner. Social media data offer new opportunities to provide more up-to-date demographic estimates and to complement more traditional data sources. Facebook’s Advertising Platform, for example, is a potentially rich data source of demographic information that is regularly updated. However, Facebook’s users are not representative of the underlying population. This paper proposes a statistical framework to combine social media data with traditional survey data to produce timely ‘nowcasts’ of migrant stocks by state in the United States. The model incorporates bias adjustment of Facebook data, and a pooled principal component time series approach, to account for correlations across age, time and space. We use the model to estimate and project migrants from Mexico, India and Germany, three migrant groups with varying levels and trends of migration in the {US}. By comparing short-term projections with data from the American Community Survey, we show that the model predictions outperform alternatives that rely solely on either social media or survey data.},

The results, which are based on {BHPS} and {GSOEP} data, suggest for Germany that occupational uncertainty hampers transitions to parenthood, but are inconclusive for the {UK}.

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between work and family among men in western Germany. We investigate the extent to which a difficult start in and insecurities during the working life affect men’s transition to fatherhood, and the degree to which this effect is influenced by characteristics of the respondent’s family of origin and his relationship history. We use proportional hazards models to analyze data of the third “Familiensurvey” conducted by the German Youth Institute in 2000. In accordance with the spillover hypothesis, which assumes that labor market success (or failure) leads to success (or failure) in family behavior, we found that under difficult and/or insecure circumstances in career patterns, men delay their transition to fatherhood. The delay is caused in particular by unemployment, self-employment or part-time work. A successful career development, however, increases the propensity to have a child soon after having taken a career step. Contrary to the hypothesis of individualization, the social status and the composition of the family of origin still have an impact on the fertility behavior of men in adulthood. In particular, the transition rate to fatherhood is higher if the man grew up with at least one sibling, while losing a parent through death decreases the rate. Both the employment career and the parental home influence the formation of steady relationships, and this explains in part their effect on the transition to fatherhood.},

It analyses both the timing of first childbearing and the fertility reached at age 40. Different indicators of declining employment security are used, i.e., current individual employment characteristics, the accumulation of unstable jobs, and aggregate-level indicators of employment uncertainty. Male unemployment has a negative influence on the timing of first childbearing, while periods of insecure employment delay fertility for women. Completed fertility is impacted by unemployment spells only for men who have faced long-term unemployment. Employment uncertainty thus tends to delay first parenthood but has a relatively weak effect on lifetime fertility in France. Generous state support to families associated with a generous unemployment insurance system, and the strong French two-child family norm, may explain why economic uncertainty affects fertility less than elsewhere.},

This paper uses distinct ﬂuctuations in unemployment rates across European countries during the 1980s and the 1990s combined with broad differences in their labor market arrangements to analyze the associations between fertility timing and the changing economic environment with close to 50,000 women from 13 European countries. First, it employs time-varying measures of aggregate market conditions in each woman’s country as covariates and second, it adds micro-measures of each woman’s labor market history to the models. High and persistent unemployment in a country is associated with delays in childbearing (and second births). The association is robust to diverse measures of unemployment and to controls for family-friendly policies. Besides moderate unemployment, a large public employment sector (which provides security and beneﬁts) is coupled with faster transitions to all births. Women with temporary contracts, mostly in Southern Europe, are the least likely to give birth to a second child.},

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate the impact of job displacement on women’s first-birth rates as well as the variation in this effect over the business cycle. We use mass layoffs to estimate the causal effects of involuntary job loss on fertility in the short and medium term, up to five years after displacement. Our analysis is based on rich administrative data from Germany, with an observation period spanning more than 20 years. We apply inverse probability weighting ({IPW}) to flexibly control for the observed differences between women who were and were not displaced. To account for the differences in the composition of the women who were displaced in a downturn and the women who were displaced in an upswing, we use a double weighting estimator. Results show that the extent to which job displacement has adverse effects on fertility depends on the business cycle. The first-birth rates were much lower for women who were displaced in an economic downturn than for those who lost a job in an economic upturn. This result cannot be explained by changes in the observed characteristics of the displaced women over the business cycle.},

Cross-country comparisons show that when parenting and employment are in conflict, this relationship is less positive for women. We lack knowledge of how this relationship is shaped by context for men and how it varies with contextual changes over time rather than between countries.
{OBJECTIVE} I investigate how the relationship between earnings and first-birth probability changes over time for men and women, in a period when efforts in parenting and paid work become increasingly similar across sex.
{METHODS} Discrete-time hazard regressions are applied to highly accurate data from Norwegian population registers. Through estimation of separate models for each of the years 1995 through 2010, I assess whether the correlation between yearly earnings and the first birth probabilities changed over period time. The correlation is estimated net of observable confounders, such as educational enrolment and attainment and region of birth.
{RESULTS} The correlation between earnings and fertility has become substantially more positive over time for women, and also somewhat more positive among men.
{CONCLUSIONS} Though the potential opportunity cost of fathering increases, there is no evidence of a weaker correlation between earnings and first birth probability for men. I suggest that decreasing opportunity costs of motherhood as well as strategic timing of fertility are both plausible explanations for the increasingly positive correlation among women.},

In contrast to other industrialized countries, however, fertility rates rose sharply in the 1980s before plummeting in the 1990s. In this paper we apply hazard regression to data from the 1992 Swedish Family Survey, supplemented by annual earnings data linked to individuals and by annual time series of national-level economic indicators, to investigate the predictors of the timing of the ﬁrst birth of women in Sweden since the mid-1960s. The discovery that both individual characteristics and aggregate-level factors inﬂuence the timing of the ﬁrst birth casts light on both the continuing trend of postponement of the ﬁrst birth and annual ﬂuctuations in ﬁrst-birth rates.},

Existing empirical studies have produced contradictory results, partly because of varying institutional contexts, the use of different measures, and left-censoring problems. We address these theoretical and methodological problems in the extant literature. Our data comes from the German Life History Study ({GLHS}) and, in particular, the data on the 1971 cohort, which was collected in two representative and retrospective surveys conducted in East and West Germany in 1996-1998 and 2005. Using monthly information, we perform event history analysis to identify the timing of fertility for both men and women conditional on a number of covariates. We present our results as a comparison between East and West Germany, as the institutional contexts, the labour markets, and the value systems differ considerably between the two parts of the German state.},

	abstract = {Unemployment, more than other activity statuses, prompts childless young women in union to delay a prospective maternity. This result is established here for women born between 1952 and 1973, on the basis of data from the Youth and Careers Survey carried out by {INSEE} in 1997. Young women confronted with a period of unemployment chose to forego their first child for a while, rather than take advantage of the "free" time imposed on them. In contrast, homemakers especially at the beginning of their union tend to have their first births much more rapidly. This result confirms that a period of unemployment is not tantamount to a period of inactivity. In matters of fertility, unemployed women are not homemakers. Economic fluctuations have an especially important impact on the early working life of the young, at the very time when they may be starting a family. The usual statistical analyses do not make it possible to demonstrate a clear link between the growth of unemployment and the increase in the age at first birth. Biographical analysis sheds light on the impact of female unemployment on childbearing plans, by including the timing of life history events of individuals among the variables that explain behaviour. In a society where contraception makes it possible for women to master the timing of their fertility and where female labour force participation has become the norm, these findings show that the family building process and the couples' decisions are now factoring in the work experience and the career goals of both partners. El paro, más que otras situaciones laborales, incita a las mujeres jóvenes en pareja y sin hijos a posponer los proyectos de maternidad. Este artículo confirma este postulado para las mujeres nacidas entre 1952 y 1973 a través de los resultados de la encuesta Jóvenes y Carreras llevado a cabo por el {INSEE} en 1997. Las mujeres jóvenes en paro renuncian temporalmente a tener un primer hijo en lugar de anticipar su llegada para aprovechar el tiempo "libre" impuesto. La situación de ama de casa, en cambio, conlleva primeras maternidades mucho más jóvenes, especialmente al inicio de la vida en pareja. Este resultado confirma que un período de desempleo no es equiparable a un periodo de inactividad: en términos de fecundidad, las desempleadas no son amas de casa. La coyuntura económica tiene un efecto importante sobre jóvenes que inician su carrera profesional, en el momento en que son susceptibles de crear una familia. Los análisis estadísticos existentes no permiten establecer una relación clara entre el aumento del paro y el retraso de la maternidad. El análisis biográfico, sin embargo, permite medir el impacto del paro femenino sobre los proyectos de descendencia ya que incluye el tiempo entre sucesos de la historia de vida de los individuos entre las variables explicativas de sus comportamientos. Una sociedad en la cual los anticonceptivos permiten controlar la fecundidad y en la cual la actividad profesional de las mujeres se ha generalizado, estos resultados muestran que las situaciones profesionales presentes y futuras de ambos cónyuges influyen en los calendarios familiares y las decisiones de las parejas.},

Even fewer studies compare how these effects vary for different groups of individuals.
{OBJECTIVE} In this study we specifically ask whether fertility timings in the United States are more sensitive to the unemployment rates of individuals’ immediate surroundings or to their own unemployment. Moreover, we investigate whether young adults with different educational levels and parental resources may adjust their childbearing timing differently in response to their own employment status and local unemployment rates.
{METHODS} Using 17 rounds of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, we fit discrete-time event history models predicting men’s and women’s pace of childbearing.
{RESULTS} The analysis indicates that relatively disadvantaged young adults, such as those with low education or parents with low education, tend to delay childbirth in response to high local unemployment rates but are less likely than the more advantaged to defer childbearing when facing their own unemployment.
{CONCLUSIONS} We argue that the disadvantaged are relatively sensitive to the local unemployment rate but relatively insensitive to their own unemployment compared to those with fewer disadvantages, because the former suffer more from unemployment in times of},

	abstract = {The U.S. period total fertility rate has declined steadily since the Great Recession, reaching 1.73 children in 2018, the lowest level since the 1970s. This pattern could mean that current childbearing cohorts will end up with fewer children than previous cohorts, or this same pattern could be an artifact of a tempo distortion if individuals are simply postponing births they plan to eventually have. In this research note, we use data on current parity and future intended births from the 2006–2017 National Survey of Family Growth to shed light on this issue. We find that total intended parity declined (from 2.26 in 2006–2010 to 2.16 children in 2013–2017), and the proportion intending to remain childless increased slightly. Decomposition indicates that the decline was not due to changes in population composition but rather changes in the subgroups’ rates themselves. The decline in intended parity is particularly notable at young ages and among those who are Hispanic. These results indicate that although tempo distortion is likely an important contributor to the decline in {TFR}, it is not the sole explanation: U.S. individuals are intending to have fewer children than their immediate predecessors, which may translate into a decline in cohort completed parity. However, the change in intended parity is modest, and average intended parity remains above two children.},

	abstract = {Permanent childlessness is increasingly acknowledged as an outcome of a dynamic, context-dependent process, but few studies have integrated a life course framework to investigate the complex pathways leading to childlessness. This study focuses on an understudied yet revealing dimension of why individuals remain childless: stated fertility expectations over the life course. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, I use a combination of sequence analysis, data-driven clustering techniques, and multivariable regression models to identify and describe groups of permanently childless women who follow similar trajectories of stated fertility expectations. Results indicate that a little more than one-half (56 \%) of eventually childless women fall into a cluster where childlessness is expected before age 30. Women in the remaining clusters (44 \%) transition to expecting childlessness later in the life course but are differentiated by the types of trajectories that precede the emergence of a childless expectation. Results from multivariable regression show that several respondent characteristics, including race/ethnicity, education, and marital history, predict cluster membership. Taken together, these findings add to a growing body of literature that provides a more nuanced description of permanently childless women and motivates further research that integrates interdependencies between life course domains and fertility expectations and decision-making of those who remain childless.},

We use a sample of 31,739 women and 24,524 men aged 18–44 from a cross-sectional and nationally representative survey, the National Survey of Family Growth. Our analyses utilize five of the survey’s cycles: from 2002 through 2015–2017. Trends in the unadjusted proportions of men and women who report {ITRCare} presented, along with predicted probabilities of reporting {ITRCfrom} multivariate regressions. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the prevalence of {ITRC} increased in the general population of men and women in the United States as well as among the youngest adults aged 18–24. If {ITRC} are realized, permanent childlessness rates could increase in the near future, contributing to the ongoing fertility decline in the United States. Further analyses uncover similarities and differences in the {ITRC} trends and correlates between men and women. Increases in {ITRC} among women are connected to changes in the sociodemographic composition of the population but {ITRCincreases} among men are not connected to population composition changes. In addition, a positive education gradient is observed in {ITRC} among women but not among men. These variations in {ITRCprompt} a call for further research into gender and intentions for childlessness.},

	abstract = {Background: Infertility affects an estimated 15\% of couples globally, amounting to 48.5 million couples. Males are found to be solely responsible for 20-30\% of infertility cases and contribute to 50\% of cases overall. However, this number does not accurately represent all regions of the world. Indeed, on a global level, there is a lack of accurate statistics on rates of male infertility. Our report examines major regions of the world and reports rates of male infertility based on data on female infertility.
Methods: Our search consisted of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and population-based studies by searching the terms “epidemiology, male infertility, and prevalence.” We identified 16 articles for detailed study. We typically used the assumption that 50\% of all cases of infertility are due to female factors alone, 20-30\% are due to male factors alone, and the remaining 20-30\% are due to a combination of male and female factors. Therefore, in regions of the world where male factor or rates of male infertility were not reported, we used this assumption to calculate general rates of male factor infertility.
Results: Our calculated data showed that the distribution of infertility due to male factor ranged from 20\% to 70\% and that the percentage of infertile men ranged from 2·5\% to 12\%. Infertility rates were highest in Africa and Central/Eastern Europe. Additionally, according to a variety of sources, rates of male infertility in North America, Australia, and Central and Eastern Europe varied from 4 5-6\%, 9\%, and 8-12\%, respectively.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates a novel and unique way to calculate the distribution of male infertility around the world. According to our results, at least 30 million men worldwide are infertile with the highest rates in Africa and Eastern Europe. Results indicate further research is needed regarding etiology and treatment, reduce stigma \& cultural barriers, and establish a more precise calculation.},

To address these concerns, this study evaluates the quality of men’s fertility data in the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}79 and {NLSY}97) and in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}). Comparing fertility rates in each survey with population rates based on data from Vital Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, we document how the incomplete reporting of births in different surveys varies according to men’s characteristics, including their age, race, marital status, and birth cohort. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on the {NSFG} data to demonstrate how birth underreporting biases associations between early parenthood and its antecedents. We find that in the {NSFG}, roughly four out of five early births were reported; but in the {NLSY}79 and {NLSY}97, almost nine-tenths of early births were reported. In all three surveys, incomplete reporting was especially pronounced for nonmarital births. Our results suggest that the quality of male fertility data is strongly linked to survey design and that it has implications for models of early male fertility.},

Using a dataset of 77 {LDCs} this paper seeks to explore which variables determine differences at a country level in marriage patterns. We look at the influence of urbanisation, education, percentage population of Muslim faith, and family type. We find that education is key in determining at what age women marry, having as would be expected a positive effect on age at first marriage and depressing spousal age gap. Urbanisation is significant, with a positive effect on age and negative on spousal age gap, although the effect is not very large. The percentage Muslim variable depresses female age at first marriage and increases spousal age gap but only when family type is not controlled for. The initially strong negative effect of percentage population Muslim over the period under consideration on age of first marriage has decreased, which raises some interesting questions about the role of Islam in female empowerment.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the fertility decline in Russia during the early and mid 1990s from both a macro- and micro-perspective and presents a striking divergence between these two empirical viewpoints. While the former suggests that the fertility decline after 1989 is associated with the economic hardship accompanying the transition to a market economy, the micro-evidence using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey is to the contrary. There is no negative association between labour market uncertainty or a labour market crisis and fertility, and frequently there is even a positive association. That is, women or couples who are themselves affected by labour market crises often had a higher probability of having another child in the period 1994–1996 than women/couples who were less affected by such crises. The lack of a negative association, and the presence of a positive association in many instances, is surprising from the standpoint of economic fertility theory. It is also contrary to many explanatory theories about the recent fertility decline in Central and Eastern European countries that are built on a more or less direct connection between the labour market or an economic crisis and low fertility.},

Based on pooled cross-sectional data, Kögel (2004) shows that (a) unmeasured country-specific factors and (b) country-heterogeneity in the magnitude of the negative time-series association accounts for the reversal in the sign of the cross-country correlation coefficient. Our paper aims to identify those variables that may explain country heterogeneity in the negative association between fertility and female labour force participation. The selection of variables is based on existing macro-demographic theories. We apply aggregate descriptive representations of the time series and cross-country evolution of fertility, female employment and a set of labour market, educational and demographic variables and indicators of social policy. /// Différents auteurs ont montré que pour les pays de l'{OCDE} la corrélation négative qui existait avant les années 1980 entre la fécondité et la participation des femmes à la force de travail s'est renversée dans les deux dernières décennies.

Dans cet article, nous essayons d'identifier les variables qui pourraient expliquer l'hétérogénéité des pays dans l'association négative entre fécondité et participation féminine au marché du travail.

However, previous research has not focused on the association between children and household worklessness. In this paper, I used {ECHP} data from nine European countries to analyse the effects of the number and age of children on the probability that neither partner of a couple works. Results from random-effects regressions show that children increase the risk of dual worklessness in ﬁve of the countries. The effects were particularly strong in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and more generally, stronger in countries with little institutional support for working mothers, low levels of employment protection, and unexpectedly, where beneﬁts were less likely to be means-tested. The risk of dual joblessness diminished with the age of the youngest child in Belgium, Finland, France and the United Kingdom and more generally, slower in countries with a strict employment protection regime and a high level of means-testing of social beneﬁts. Having children can thus affect the labour market position of households, and inﬂuence their economic well-being. However, these effects can be shaped by the social policy and labour market solutions countries adopt.},

It starts from the hypothesis that cultural values moderate individuals’ reactions to job insecurity and the way it is related to family formation. With a systematic thematic content analysis of a set of semi-structured interviews with childless men and women around the age of 30 in eastern and western Germany, we are able to show that there are substantial differences in the consequences of job insecurity on intentions to have a ﬁrst child. In western Germany, a relatively secure job career is expected to precede family formation, and this sequence of transitions is rather rigid, whereas in eastern Germany job security and family formation are thought of and practiced as parallel investments. We suggest that the lack of convergence in family formation patterns between eastern and western Germany after the uniﬁcation of the country in 1990 is partially related to different attitudes toward job insecurity in the two contexts.},

Men, once neglected, are now included in research on fertility but from a narrow, overly problem-oriented perspective. A review of the literature, however, raises questions about the adequacy of a problem-oriented approach. The authors argue that demography should focus on men not only as women's partners, but also as individuals with distinct reproductive histories. In situations, now increasingly common, where the links between marriage and childbearing erode, the differences in men's and women's reproductive experiences and the costs and benefits of parenting will become more salient for future research.},

On the other, for purposes of analysis, the features of both partners in the decision to have a child can be analysed. The analysis is based on the Familiensurvey 2000, which is representative for Germany. The “union course” approach provides quite a different picture of fertility development than does the life course approach. Among the main results: There is no increase in childlessness within unions, i.e. the considerable increase in childlessness in life course studies is to a considerable extent due to the lack of a partner. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the persistence of a union contributes to the decision to have a second child but limits couples from having further children.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The use of long-acting reversible contraceptive ({LARC}) methods—intrauterine devices ({IUDs}) and implants—has recently expanded rapidly in the United States, and these methods together approach the contraceptive pill in current prevalence. Research on {LARCs} has analyzed their use to reduce unintended pregnancies but not their use to enable intended pregnancies. Knowledge of both is necessary to understand {LARCs}’ potential impacts on the reproductive life courses of U.S. women. We combine data from two nationally representative surveys to estimate women's likelihood and timing of subsequent reproductive events, including births resulting from an intended pregnancy up to nine years after discontinuing {LARC} use. We estimate that 62\% of women will give birth, and 45\% will give birth from an intended pregnancy. Additionally, 18\% will have a new {LARC} inserted, and 13\% will transition to sterilization. Most of these reproductive events occur within two years after discontinuing {LARC} use. Births from an intended pregnancy are especially common when no intervening switch to another contraceptive method occurs. We infer that women's motives for using {LARC} are varied but include the desire to postpone a birth, to postpone a decision about whether to have a(nother) birth, and to transition definitively to the completion of childbearing.},

	abstract = {Objective—The objective was to examine levels of, correlates of and changes in the use of individual and grouped methods of contraception among {US} females aged 15–44 from 2008 to 2014. Study design—Using three rounds of the National Survey of Family Growth, we analyzed samples of 12,279 (2008), 5601 (2012) and 5699 (2014) females. We conducted simple and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify associations between demographic characteristics and contraceptive use, as well as between characteristics and changes in use patterns.
Results—In terms of overall trends in contraceptive use between 2008 and 2014, there was no significant change in the proportion of women who used a method among either all women (60\%) or those at risk of unintended pregnancy (90\%). Significant changes in use occurred among six methods. The largest increase in use was among users of long-acting reversible contraceptive ({LARC}) methods, including the intrauterine device and implant — from 6\% to 14\% — across almost all population groups of female contraceptive users, while the largest decrease occurred among users of sterilization — from 37\% to 28\% — with lower-income women driving the decline in female sterilization and higher-income women driving the decline in a partner’s sterilization as a primary method. Moderate increases were seen in the use of withdrawal and natural family planning.
Conclusion—Most shifts in recent contraceptive use have occurred among the most effective methods — sterilization and {LARCs}. Differences in method-specific user characteristics underscore the importance of ensuring full access to the broad range of methods available.},

	abstract = {Prior life course theory research reveals the existence of age deadlines for both starting and completing childbearing and that age is a salient dimension that structures and regulates individuals’ childbearing plans for women and men. We argue that the advent of the Internet, which has revolutionised access to information on the potential consequences for health of important behavioural choices, might have influenced the perception of age deadlines for childbearing. We hypothesize that this occurred because the internet provided further access to, for example, information on contraception methods, reproductive technologies and agerelated infertility. In this study, we use the 2006-2007 European Social Survey and test whether using the Internet every day is associated with upper, lower and ideal age deadlines for childbearing for men and women. The unadjusted results show that using the Internet everyday (which 27\% of the respondents declared to do) was positively and significantly associated with later (upper, lower, ideal) age deadlines for both women and men. The effects were stronger for men, which could reflect the health concerns (often discussed in online forums and websites) towards pregnancies at ages 35 or above for women. In models adjusted for individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics and health (e.g. education, income, marital status, parenthood, self-rated health), the associations were partially attenuated but remained positive and statistically significant. Overall, the findings suggest that access to the Internet could represent a key driving factor behind individuals’ postponement of age deadlines for childbearing and, consequently, of childbearing behaviours.},

Using a proximate determinants of fertility framework and decomposition techniques, we consider the importance of changes in relationship status, contraceptive use, and other dimensions of deliberate fertility control in understanding trends in the non-marital fertile pregnancy rate between 2004 and 2014. We use data from several cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth to identify relationship and contraceptive use status at the time of conception for pregnancies that resulted or were likely to result in live births (i.e., fertile pregnancies), and focus our analysis on non-Hispanic Black women in their twenties. We find that changes in relationship status and sexual activity did not contribute to the decline in fertile pregnancy rates, nor did changes in the distribution of contraceptive method use. Instead, changing fertile pregnancy rates within contraceptive use categories, including among those who report using no method of contraception, account for the observed trend. Though contraceptive method mix is an insufficient explanation for recent trends, our results suggest that considering the sources of within-method variation in fertile pregnancy rates over time is key to understanding declines in non-marital births, and that some women not using contraception likely engaged in a form of deliberate fertility control not captured by the National Survey of Family Growth.},

Using the same data, our age 30 estimates are 55\% and 87\% for women born 1939–1948 and 1969–1978. Our analyses thus document strikingly different levels and trends. {METHODS} We replicate Finer’s single-decrement Kaplan–Meier estimates of premarital sex using Cycles 3–6 of the National Survey of Family Growth, the same data as analyzed by him. We then contrast such single-decrement estimates for both premarital sex and first marriage with estimates of the simple percentages in three states: an origin state in which women begin life as never-married virgins and two destination states for first sex and for first marriage, depending on which occurs first. These analyses provide an empirical illustration of the fact that single-decrement estimates cannot be interpreted as simple percentages for demographic processes involving multiple decrements. {RESULTS} Our cohort estimates document increases in the percent of {US} women who had premarital sex by age 25, rising from 53\% to 75\%, 83\%, and 87\% for those born 1939–1948, 1949–1958, 1959–1968, and 1969–1978, respectively. {CONTRIBUTION} Our cohort analyses reveal sharp increases in premarital sex for {US} women born between 1939 and 1968, with increases most rapid for those born in the 1940s and 1950s.

	abstract = {Abstract
            We examine cohort trends in premarital first births for U.S. women born between 1920 and 1964. The rise in premarital first births is often argued to be a consequence of the retreat from marriage, with later ages at first marriage resulting in more years of exposure to the risk of a premarital first birth. However, cohort trends in premarital first births may also reflect trends in premarital sexual activity, premarital conceptions, and how premarital conceptions are resolved. We decompose observed cohort trends in premarital first births into components reflecting cohort trends in (1) the age-specific risk of a premarital conception taken to term; (2) the age-specific risk of first marriages not preceded by such a conception, which will influence women’s years of exposure to the risk of a premarital conception; and (3) whether a premarital conception is resolved by entering a first marriage before the resulting first birth (a “shotgun marriage”). For women born between 1920–1924 and 1945–1949, increases in premarital first births were primarily attributable to increases in premarital conceptions. For women born between 1945–1949 and 1960–1964, increases in premarital first births were primarily attributable to declines in responding to premarital conceptions by marrying before the birth. Trends in premarital first births were affected only modestly by the retreat from marriages not preceded by conceptions—a finding that holds for both whites and blacks. These results cast doubt on hypotheses concerning “marriageable” men and instead suggest that increases in premarital first births resulted initially from increases in premarital sex and then later from decreases in responding to a conception by marrying before a first birth.},

	abstract = {The rise in educational enrolment is often cited as a possible cause of the trend to later childbearing in developed societies but direct evidence of its contribution to the aggregate change in fertility tempo is scarce. We show that rising enrolment, resulting in later ages at the end of education, accounts for a substantial part of the upward shift in the mean age at first birth in the 1980s and 1990s in Britain and in France. The postponement of first birth over that period has two components: a longer average period of enrolment and a post-enrolment component that is also related to educational level. The relationship between rising educational participation and the move to later fertility timing is almost certainly causal. Our findings therefore suggest that fertility tempo change is rooted in macro-economic and structural forces rather than in the cultural domain.},

We use long series of age-specific fertility rates from the Human Fertility Database (1950–2016) for women, and new data covering the period 1990–2016 for men. In 1950, the contribution of births at age 40 and over to female fertility rates ranged from 2.5 to 9 percent, but then fell sharply until the 1980s. From the 1990s, however, the prevalence of late first births increased rapidly, especially so in countries where it was initially lowest. This has produced a late fertility rebound in the last two decades, occurring much faster for women than for men. Comparisons between recent and past extremely late (age 48+) fertility levels confirm that people are now challenging the natural fertility barriers, particularly for a first child.},

It analyses the contribution of migrants to the total number of births and compares fertility rates of migrant women with the fertility rates of native women, pointing out huge diversity between migrant groups. It also discusses the evidence regarding the progressive ‘assimilation’ in migrants’ fertility to the local fertility patterns and analyses the net impact of migrants on period fertility rates. This review reveals that migrant women typically retain substantially higher levels of period fertility than the ‘native’ populations, but this difference typically diminishes over time and with the duration of their stay in a country. Immigrants contribute substantially to the total number of births and their share of total births has increased in the last decade, exceeding in some countries one fifth of the recorded live births. However, the ‘net effect’ of the higher fertility of migrants on the period total fertility of particular countries remains relatively small, typically between 0.05 and 0.10 in absolute terms.},

Because reproduction is shaped by the entire life cycle, sex ratio theory would benefit from explicitly two-sex models that include some form of life cycle structure. We present a demographic approach to sex ratio evolution that combines adaptive dynamics with nonlinear matrix population models. We also determine the evolutionary and convergence stability of singular strategies using matrix calculus. These methods allow the incorporation of any population structure, including multiple sexes and stages, into evolutionary projections. Using this framework, we compare how four different interpretations of sex-biased offspring costs affect sex ratio evolution. We find that demographic differences affect evolutionary outcomes and that, contrary to prior belief, sex-biased mortality after parental investment can bias the primary sex ratio (but not the corresponding reproductive value ratio). These results differ qualitatively from the widely held conclusions of previous models that neglect demographic structure.},

            Using the 2002 (Cycle 6) National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}), which was the first {NSFG} to interview men, we document the prevalence and correlates of sequential parenthood with different partners (multipartnered fertility) among a representative sample of American men. Nearly 8\% of American men aged 15–44 report having had children with more than one partner, with sharp differences by age, race/ethnicity, and income—over one-third of poor black men aged 35–44 report having had children with two or more mothers, and 16\% report children with three or more mothers. Fathers of two or more children by multiple partners appear to be more disadvantaged than fathers with two or more children by the same partner. Multipartnered fertility is strongly related to prior birth characteristics; men not in a coresidential union at the preceding birth are more likely to have their next birth with a new partner, and controlling for prior-birth characteristics accounts for the elevated risk of Hispanics and blacks in baseline models. Results also suggest that multipartnered fertility is becoming more prevalent as younger cohorts transition to a new-partner birth more quickly and at a higher rate than older cohorts.},

As a consequence, a progressive increase in the sex ratio at the beginning of the reproductive age (15–19 years) occurred, so that in recent times the sex ratio in the young adult population has approached the almost constant value of 1.06 observed at birth. We calculated that the sex composition would be the same in newborns and in young adults in about one generation: obviously, we have to assume that the sex differentials in mortality and migration are constant over time. The 1:1 equilibrium between sexes, which maximizes reproductive success, occurred in the 15–19 age group at the beginning of the century and shifted to the 30–35 age group in the 1990s. We compared the 1993–1995 sex ratios in different age groups in European Union countries and observed that in Italy as well as in other Mediterranean countries the numerical equality between sexes is reached at 30–35 years of age, while in north-central Europe it is reached later, approximately at the end of reproductive life.},

In addition, the importance of these processes to fathering children as well as to later paternal involvement is highlighted.

Individual characteristics of the childless and reasons for childlessness are investigated. As many as one-third of the interviewees who live with a partner and do not suffer from any physical impediment are voluntarily childless. These women, in contrast to mothers, appear to be less religious and to have partners who are less religious; they tend to come from smaller families; to have been in a nonmarital cohabitation at least once in life; to have entered their first union later; and to have had, in the initial period of their union, temporary work and flexible work schedules and limited leisure time. In other cases, childlessness is the unintended outcome of a decision to delay having a child or the result of adverse external circumstances, particularly dissolution of partnership.},

Data come from Finnish Social Relationships and Well-being Survey, conducted in 2008 among 25-44-year-old childless or one-child men and women. This study focuses on childless respondents (N=1244). Two types of intentional childlessness are distinguished. Persons are classified as voluntarily childless if they do not intend to have children and prefer life without children. Those, who also have no intentions to have children, but whose personal ideal number of children is above zero are defined as persons who have relinquished parenthood intentions. Childhood characteristics are found to predict voluntary childlessness more, while socioeconomic circumstances and lack of a suitable partner explain relinquished parenthood intentions. Respondents’personal accounts on the reasons behind their childbearing choices support the findings from multivariate analyses.},

Positive selection on male wealth appears to be a recurrent feature of human agrarian and pastoralist societies, and there is some evidence of it in industrial populations, too. Here we investigate the strength of selection on male wealth, ﬁrst in contemporary Britain using data from the National Child Development Study and then across seven other varied human societies. The British data show positive selection on male income driven by increased childlessness among low-income men but a negative association between personal income and reproductive success for women. Across cultures, selection gradients for male wealth are weakest in industrial countries and strongest in subsistence societies with extensive polygyny. Even the weakest selection gradients observed for male wealth in humans are as strong as or stronger than selection gradients reported from ﬁeld studies of other species. Thus, selection on male wealth in contemporary humans appears to be ubiquitous and substantial in strength.},

	abstract = {The association between reproductive success and income in economically developed societies remains a controversial and understudied topic. The commonly made statement that individuals with a higher income have fewer children defies evolutionary explanation. Here we present results from an analyses of the association between lifetime reproductive success ({LRS}) and income for modern Europeans from 13 countries. We examine the relationships among income, partner income, sex and {LRS}, and the role of childlessness in driving the relationships. For women, we find a negative association between {LRS} and income, while for men, we find a flat or slightly positive one. The sex difference in the association appears to be driven by income's sex-specific association with childlessness; men with a low income have a relatively high risk of childlessness, while women with a low income have a low risk of childlessness. Consequently, once childless people are excluded from the analysis, {LRS} is negatively associated with income for both sexes. We argue that the observed {LRS}–income associations may be an outcome of evolved behavioural predispositions operating in modern environments and conclude that, even though humans fail to maximise {LRS} at all income levels in modern settings, evolutionary theory can still help to explain sex differences in {LRS}. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that men’s educational attainment consistently and positively affects the transition to fatherhood via higher rates of union formation. We apply multiprocess event-history analysis to data from the Generations and Gender Surveys for 10 European countries. Our results show indeed a consistent positive effect of education on the transition to fatherhood, but it operates chiefly through selection into union. Failing to account for this selection process leads to a major underestimation of the salience of education for the transition to fatherhood.},

Effects of these indicators are estimated for the transition to marriage and cohabitation, as well as for the transition from cohabitation to marriage. Country differences in these effects are examined as well. The evidence provides strong support for the male breadwinner hypothesis on the one hand, and for Oppenheimer’s career uncertainty hypothesis on the other.

            Despite the dramatic rise in U.S. nonmarital childbearing in recent decades, limited attention has been paid to factors affecting nonmarital fatherhood (beyond studies of young fathers). In this article, we use data from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort to examine the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood, as compared to marital fatherhood. Overall, we find the strongest support across both data sets for education and race/ethnicity as key predictors of having a nonmarital first birth, consistent with prior literature about women’s nonmarital childbearing and about men’s early/teenage fatherhood. Education is inversely related to the risk of nonmarital fatherhood, and minority (especially black) men are much more likely to have a child outside of marriage than white men. We find little evidence that employment predicts nonmarital fertility, although it does strongly (and positively) predict marital fertility. High predicted earnings are also associated with a greater likelihood of marital childbearing but with a lower likelihood of nonmarital childbearing. Given the socioeconomic disadvantage associated with nonmarital fatherhood, this research suggests that nonmarital fatherhood may be an important aspect of growing U.S. inequality and stratification both within and across generations.},

Explanations for the retreat from marriage among Black women have focused on deficits in the quantity and quality of available partners, and the role of racial intermarriage largely has been ignored. This study examines the impact of interracial marriage by Black men on the marriage prospects of Black women. First, our analysis of data from the 1990 Integrated Public Use Microdata Series ({IPUMS}) reveals that intermarried Black men are selective of those with the highest levels of education, income, and occupational prestige. Second, multilevel analyses, using both the {IPUMS} and Panel Study of Income Dynamics, show that the level of intermarriage in metropolitan areas is significantly related to the marital behaviors of Black women. Local rates of intermarriage among Black men reduce the likelihood that Black women currently will be married and that they will make the transition to marriage. These effects are especially acute for highly educated Black women whose marriage markets are defined by those Black men who are most likely to intermarry. Finally, our analyses indicate that intermarriage affects the marital prospects of Black women by negatively affecting the pool of economically attractive marriage partners in the metropolitan area.},

Couples are also more likely to divorce when the wife works in an occupation having relatively many men and few women, but husbands' occupational sex ratio has no effect on the risk of marital dissolution. The destabilizing effects of the availability of spousal alternatives in the local marriage market and in wives' occupations are equally strong among couples with many and few other risk factors for divorce. Our findings suggest that spouses' structural opportunities to form alternative opposite-sex relationships are an important factor in explaining why some couples divorce.},

The effect of mate availability on nonmarital fertility is generally modest. Among white women, marriage opportunities are associated inversely with the nonmarital fertility rate, perhaps reflecting an increased likelihood that a premarital conception will be legitimated. Marriage opportunities also reduce nonmarital fertility ratios for young black and white women. The nonmarital fertility rate is lower among women whose marriage pool includes a large percentage of nonemployed males.

How this stationary population is created is studied, as is the generational distribution of the constant annual stream of births and of the total population.

We prove that the asymptotic ratio between foreign-born and native-born does not depend on the size of the immigration flow, but solely on the relative fertility of the two groups, the sex ratio, and age distribution of the immigrants. In contrast to the continuous-time approach in which deep results of renewal theory have been used to establish this result, our proof is elementary. The analytical model is supplemented by numerical simulations with German data which show the effects of continuous immigration on the size of the population and on the ratio of foreign-born citizens in the united Germany under different demographic regimes.},

The present paper develops expressions for the effect on ultimate population of given numbers of out- or in-migrants, expressed as a function of their age. The main relations are (9) for one-time migration and (12) for a continuous stream of migrants, the former affecting only the level of the ultimate population, the latter affecting its rate of growth as well. The age effect is appreciable, but is not sufficient to encourage a policy of moving people. Neither internal movement within a country nor movement to foreign countries is a substitute for contraception as a means of population control.},

By looking at child migrants whose fertility behavior is neither interrupted by the migration event nor confounded by selection, the authors obtain a unique perspective on the adaptation process as a mechanism that explains variation in observed foreign and native-born fertility differentials. The authors find patterns that are broadly consistent with the adaptation hypothesis?which posits that as migrants become accustomed to their host countries, their fertility norms begin to resemble those of the native population?and, on average, limited cross-national variation in fertility differentials. The effect of exposure to the host country, however, seems to vary by country of origin, a finding that underscores the importance of taking into account the heterogeneity of the foreign-born population.},

	abstract = {Studies of immigrant fertility differentials indicate that foreign-born women have more children than native-born women, at least for some origin groups. Yet little is known about variation in cumulative fertility differentials over the life course, including the extent to which this variation develops into completed fertility differentials. This research responds with an analysis of cumulative fertility differentials in the {UK} for a cohort of women born between 1942 and 1971. Findings are consistent with age-specific patterns that have been documented for immigrant groups in the {UK}, but underline the importance of taking a cohort perspective, which helps to distinguish between the tempo and quantum of fertility. Immigrants have significantly higher completed fertility than {UK}-born natives if they were born in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Jamaica, or Western and Central Africa, but the profile of their cumulative fertility differentials—versus the {UK}-born—varies considerably over the life course, especially by age at migration. For example, women from Bangladesh and Pakistan have similar levels of cumulative fertility at age 40, but very different age patterns of cumulative fertility from ages 20–40. There is a consistent pattern of relatively delayed Pakistani fertility at early ages, especially for those arriving at later ages, but the same is not true for women from Bangladesh. Overall, these results imply that researchers should beware of variation in cohort fertility over the life course—with respect to both the quantum and tempo of fertility—when analysing immigrant childbearing, in addition to variation by origin and age at arrival.},

	abstract = {Different measures of fertility have strengths and limitations when used to describe the fertility of immigrants, and no single measure captures every aspect of this complex phenomenon. This paper introduces a novel visual framework that shows life course profiles of immigrant childbearing in a multifaceted way. It develops the well-known cohort fertility curve—showing the average number of children ever born over the life course—and adds lines for immigrant women arriving at different ages, using their average number of children born on arrival as a starting point. These immigrant fertility profiles can illustrate a number of important aspects of childbearing simultaneously, including children born before arrival, fertility after arrival and completed fertility at the end of childbearing. In addition to showing numbers of children born (i.e. fertility quantum), the slopes of each profile indicate the tempo of fertility and how this changes by age and duration of residence. The fertility profiles of different immigrant groups can be plotted in the same graph, and can be compared and contrasted with non-immigrant groups—at origin as well as destination—through the augmentation of each visualisation. Using Nordic register data, we illustrate how these fertility profiles can be used to expand our knowledge of immigrant childbearing and to investigate various hypotheses of migrant fertility, giving a novel overview of the relationships between fertility measures such as period and quantum, before and after arrival.},

	abstract = {This paper considers international migration in the context of population ageing. In many Western countries, the search for appropriate responses to manage future population ageing and population decline has directed attention to international migration. It seems reasonable to believe that international migrants, mostly of young working age, can supply population deficits created by low birth rates, protect European society and economy from the economic costs of elderly dependency, and provide a workforce to care for the elderly. Particular prominence has been given to this option through the publicity attendant on a report from the {UN} Population Division in 2000 on ‘replacement migration’, which has been widely reported and widely misunderstood. Although immigration can prevent population decline, it is already well known that it can only prevent population ageing at unprecedented, unsustainable and increasing levels of inflow, which would generate rapid population growth and eventually displace the original population from its majority position. This paper reviews these arguments in the context of the causes and inevitability of population ageing, with examples mostly based on {UK} data. It discusses various options available in response to population ageing through workforce, productivity, pensions reform and other means. It concludes that there can be no ‘solution’ to population ageing, which is to a considerable degree unavoidable. However, if the demographic regime of the United Kingdom continues to be relatively benign, future population ageing can be managed with tolerable inconvenience without recourse to increased immigration for ‘demographic’ purposes. At present (2001), net immigration to the United Kingdom is already running at record levels and is now the main engine behind {UK} population and household growth. By itself, population stabilization, or even mild reduction, is probably to be welcomed in the United Kingdom, although the issue has attracted little attention since the 1970s.},

	abstract = {Population ageing is a global trend that affects individual life plans, family arrangements, market structures, care provisions and pension schemes. We combine insights from demography and lifecourse research to understand better the causes of population ageing. Demography explains population ageing by describing changes in fertility, mortality and migration rates. Lifecourse research argues that these rates are interconnected because they are embedded in the lifecourses of individuals. An individual’s experiences at an early age can inﬂuence behaviours at a later age, thereby creating continuity throughout the lifecourse. Additionally, lifecourse research underlines that social networks – such as families – and countries inﬂuence lifecourse. Thus, historical events and past experiences have already set the course for today’s demographic changes. Moreover, the effects of policies that strive to inﬂuence population ageing will not be evident for years or even decades to come. This paper introduces a conceptual framework that explains how the lifecourse perspective can be applied to the phenomenon of population ageing and illustrates the framework through a case study of Germany. The case study highlights that insights from the micro-, meso- and macro-levels need to be combined to achieve a deeper understanding of population ageing. Scholars can use the framework presented in this paper as a guideline for merging arguments from demography and lifecourse research in future studies.},

Our analysis has three main ®ndings. First, in {SI} populations, a younger population (a lower aging ratio) does not necessarily have a lower dependency ratio. An {SI} population has a lower dependency ratio than a closed stationary population, provided immigration is concentrated around the youngest working age in the host population. Second, under the same condition, selecting high-fertility immigrants increases the dependency ratio. Third, also under the same condition, substituting working-age immigrants with young (dependent) immigrants increases the dependency ratio.

This paper discusses two demographic processes affected by changes in age structure. First, there are effects on vital rates, with important differences in the observed crude rates and the implied intrinsic vital rates. Second, changes in age structure influence population momentum. More recently, demographers have noted that older age distributions associated with fertility levels below replacement have negative population momentum. Although the demographic transition has been well-described for many countries, demographers have seldom analyzed intrinsic vital rates and population momentum over time, which are dynamic processes affected by changes in the population age structure and which, in turn, influence future changes in population growth and size. This paper uses new data and methods to analyze intrinsic vital rates and population momentum across two centuries of demographic change in Canada.},

            Crucial to the long-term contribution of immigration to a receiving country’s population is the extent to which the immigrants reproduce themselves in subsequent, native-born generations. Using conventional projection methodologies, this fertility contribution may be poorly estimated primarily because of problems in projecting the number of immigrants who are at risk of childbearing. We propose an alternative method that obviates the need to project the number of immigrants by using the full sending-country birth cohort as the risk group to project their receiving-country childbearing. This “sending-country birth cohort” method is found to perform dramatically better than conventional methods when projecting to 1999 from base years both before and after the large increase in inflows of Mexican immigrants to the United States in the late 1980s. Projecting forward from 1999, we estimate a cumulative contribution of Mexican immigrant fertility from the 1980s to 2040 of 36 million births, including 25\% to 50\% more births after 1995 than are projected using conventional methods.},

We used a rich longitudinal dataset from the German Socio-Economic Panel and applied event-history techniques to examine the risk of divorce among immigrants in Germany. Our analysis of the divorce rates of 5,648 marriages shows that immigrant couples have  a lower risk of divorce than do natives. However, marriages between German-born individuals and immigrants have a higher likelihood of separation than marriages between two German-born individuals or between immigrants from the same country, supporting the exogamy hypothesis. This pattern largely persists when controlling for the socio-demographic and human-capital characteristics of the spouses. The divorce risk increases with the cultural distance between the partners and when the spouses demonstrate differences in their social backgrounds, also supporting the heterogamyhypothesis and the selectivity hypothesis. We found no support for the adaptation and convergence hypotheses. Divorce levels for mixed marriages are neither similar to the levels of one of the constituent origin groups, nor do they fall between the levels of the two groups; the divorce levels for native/immigrant marriages are higher than those for endogamous marriages.},

We first review recent life-course research on fertility of immigrants and their descendants followed by a summary of the papers of this special collection.

Some groups have fertility levels similar to those of natives, some have lower fertility, and some exhibit significantly higher fertility. Further, polarisation characterises many descendant groups; some individuals have small families or even remain childless, whereas others have large families. {CONCLUSIONS} We conclude that factors related to mainstream society, minority subculture, and minority status all shape fertility behaviour of the descendants of immigrants and that their impact varies across descendant groups. Future research should investigate whether the observed heterogeneity in childbearing patterns is likely to decline over generations or the diversity is here to stay.},

This phenomenon has been pervasively observed, but often only conceptualized and estimated relative to nonmigrants in the destination country. In response, here we reconceptualize and reestimate the advantage relative to nonmigrants in their country of origin. Specifically, we calculate and compare allcause adult mortality and tertiary-level educational attainment of the 35 largest migrant groups in England and Wales to populations in their country of origin. Nearly every migrant group experiences an age-adjusted (20+) mortality advantage versus origin and versus destination, with variation in the size of the former strongly positively correlated with the development level of the country of origin. We also find that the advantage versus origin is much larger at peak migration ages. For education, migrant groups are systematically more highly educated over age. Our findings provide valuable insight into the patterns and causes of the migrant mortality advantage. Most notably, they are consistent with selection as a main explanation.},

Yet there has been little focus on this aspect of family behaviour for immigrants and their descendants. We argue that this is an important omission, not least because the mean age gaps across generations can be interpreted as a macro-level indicator of adaptation. Our study examines the age gaps of immigrants and their descendants in Sweden, a country with high gender equality and a stable mean age gap. Since the late 1960s, Swedish men have been around 2 years older, on average, than their female partners. Using longitudinal data for the whole population of Sweden, we examine changes in age gaps for cohorts born 1950-1986. We show that cohort trends in age gaps often follow very different patterns for male and female immigrant groups, with limited evidence of adaptation across cohorts. However, there is considerable evidence of adaptation toward the Swedish norm for the second generation, including when making a direct comparison between immigrants and their children, although more so for male immigrants, in part due to patterns of partnership with the Swedish-born.},

	abstract = {Most demographic models consider only one sex, usually the female. The widespread occurrence of sexual dimorphism in life history traits and the occurrence of skewed and fluctuating sex ratios suggest that one-sex models or those dominated by one sex may often be less appropriate than two-sex models. Reproduction in two-sex models is a frequency-dependent nonlinear function (the birth or marriage function) of the relative abundance of males and females. In this paper, we examine the population dynamics resulting from three different two-sex, discrete-time, population-projection models. For a large class of birth functions, models without inter-stage mate competition are shown to converge to a locally stable adult sex ratio. Formulas for the stable population structure, stable sex ratio, and reproductive value at equilibrium are derived. When individuals of different stages compete for mates, the equilibrium population structure may become unstable. A sequence of bifurcations then occurs, leading to periodic oscillations, quasi-periodic fluctuations, and chaos as the intensity of competition increases. Finally, when per capita fecundity is a sigmoid function of the relative abundance of the other sex, perturbations of the sex ratio may lead to extinction.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Previous kinship models analyze female kin through female lines of descent, neglecting male kin and male lines of descent. Because males and females differ in mortality and fertility, including both sexes in kinship models is an important unsolved problem.
          
          
            Objectives
            The objectives are to develop a kinship model including female and male kin through all lines of descent, to explore approximations when full sex-specific rates are unavailable, and to apply the model to several populations as an example.
          
          
            Methods
            The kin of a focal individual form an age×sex-classified population and are projected as Focal ages using matrix methods, providing expected age-sex structures for every type of kin at every age of Focal. Initial conditions are based on the distribution of ages at maternity and paternity.
          
          
            Results
            The equations for two-sex kinship dynamics are presented. As an example, the model is applied to populations with large (Senegal), medium (Haiti), and small (France) differences between female and male fertility. Results include numbers and sex ratios of kin as Focal ages. An approximation treating female and male rates as identical provides some insight into kin numbers, even when male and female rates are very different.
          
          
            Contribution
            Many demographic and sociological parameters (e.g., aspects of health, bereavement, labor force participation) differ markedly between the sexes. This model permits analysis of such parameters in the context of kinship networks. The matrix formulation makes it possible to extend the two-sex analysis to include kin loss, multistate kin demography, and time varying rates.},

	abstract = {Measures of community population composition, such as residential segregation, are important theoretical mechanisms that have the potential to explain differences in fertility between immigrants, their descendants, and destination natives. However, only a handful of studies explore these mechanisms, and most are limited by the fact that they carry out cross-sectional analysis. This study proposes a new approach, which focuses on community composition in childhood. It uses longitudinal census data and registered births in England and Wales to investigate the relationship between completed fertility and multiple measures of community composition, including residential segregation. The results show that the fertility of immigrants is closer to native fertility if they grow up in less segregated areas. This provides evidence in support of the childhood socialisation hypothesis. Furthermore, residential segregation explains some of the variation in completed fertility for second-generation women from Pakistan and Bangladesh, the only second-generation group to have significantly higher completed fertility than natives. This suggests one reason why the fertility of some South Asians in England and Wales may remain “culturally entrenched.” All of these findings are consistent for different measures of community composition. They are also easier to interpret than the results of previous research because exposure is measured before childbearing has commenced, therefore avoiding many issues relating to selection, simultaneity, and conditioning on the future.},

In the absence of longitudinal or life history data, the kinds of forces affecting immigrant group fertility can be inferred by: 1) examining the degree to which Mexican-origin women disaggregated by nativity or generational groups differ in fertility behavior from non-Hispanic Whites; 2) analyzing both current and cumulative fertility; 3) comparing the fertility of nativity or generational groups disaggregated by age of women and period of immigration; and 4) conducting cohort analyses between more than one time period. The findings show evidence of both assimilation and disruption effects on reproductive behavior. Fertility is found to decline the greater the length of familial exposure to the United States and, in the case of younger groups of immigrant women, to fall below the level of U.S.-born Mexican-origin and non-Hispanic White women when other variables are held constant. These results illustrate why assimilation effects on immigrant group fertility have often not emerged in previous research. They also imply that the fertility behavior of the Mexican-origin population is likely to come to resemble that of the rest of the population the longer this group resides in the United States.},

We find that both the recent and cumulative fertility of immigrant women is higher than that of native-born women, but that a large share of these differentials can be “explained” by differences in age structures, race and ethnicity, years in the United States, and country of origin. Using a synthetic cohort approach, we examine the role of years in the United States in more detail, and find no evidence of assimilation towards native-born fertility patterns. Consistent with previous research, we find evidence of a disruption effect on fertility – the fertility of immigrant women in the most recent arrival cohorts is low, but increases at a faster rate relative to both the fertility of immigrants from earlier cohorts and relative to the fertility of natives. We find that immigrants experience lower mortality than native-born individuals in the United States, and these differences remain even after controlling for underlying differences in observable characteristics. However we find that they do not exhibit differences in their subjective expectations of their mortality.},

{RESULTS} Fertility rates peak in the first one to four years subsequent to arrival among migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Migrants from India and Poland show a delay in childbearing after migration to England and Wales, and lower fertility rates compared to migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh, who show high fertility after migration at least for the first five years.

            In recent decades, rapid growth of the U.S. Hispanic population has raised concerns about immigrant adaptation, including fertility. Empirical research suggests that Hispanics, especially Mexicans, might not be following the historical European pattern of rapid intergenerational fertility decline (and convergence toward native levels). If confirmed, continued high Hispanic fertility could indicate a broader lack of assimilation into mainstream American society. In this paper, we reexamine the issue of Hispanic and Mexican fertility using an approach that combines biological and immigrant generations to more closely approximate a comparison of immigrant women with those of their daughters’ and granddaughters’ generation. Contrary to cross-sectional results, our new analyses show that Hispanic and Mexican fertility is converging with that of whites, and that it is similarly responsive to period conditions and to women’s level of education. In addition, we employ a mathematical simulation to illustrate the conditions under which cross-sectional analyses can produce misleading results. Finally, we discuss the import of the fertility convergence we document for debates about immigrant assimilation.},

This represents a reversal of the historical pattern that can perhaps be partly explained by the more pronounced decline of fertility among the Canadian-born compared with the foreign-born population and the higher proportion of Non-Europeans among recent immigrants. Recent studies also provide support for the disruption hypothesis which suggests that during the period immediately following immigration, foreign-born fertility is depressed but subsequently rises somewhat and then declines as duration of stay in Canada increases. However, this article shows that fertility immediately following immigration does not appear to be disrupted by the immigration process: immigrant women who came to Canada between 1986 and 1991 had a higher current fertility than those who immigrated in earlier periods. This finding was obtained by calculating the ratio of infants age 0 to women of childbearing ages using 1991 census data.

We use event history as a quantitative translation of the life-course approach. The data examined are the Italian Families and Social Subjects ({FSS}) survey, conducted in 2003, and the Russian Parents and Children, Men and Women in Family and Society survey, conducted in 2004. We examine the data sets separately and contrast the results. The objective of the study is twofold. First, we seek to determine whether differences exist in the decision and timing of childbearing between native and immigrant women in Italy and in Russia. Second, we aim to compare the experiences of immigrants in the two countries, to determine whether there may be any commonalities inherent to the immigrant populations despite moving into widely different contexts. Our results suggest that the age profiles and marital status similarly affect the immigrant regardless of whether she is migrating to Russia or to Italy. In Italy, educational attainment is positively correlated with first-birth intensities for immigrants – the opposite of what is observed for the native-born. In Russia, education is not a significant determinant for immigrants. This leads us to the following conclusion: the similarity in the risk profiles of our immigrants into vastly different country contexts is more suggestive of immigrants following a distinct life course, with common risk profiles for bearing their first child, than assimilating or conforming to the native fertility patterns. Social capital in particular may play a different role in determining fertility patterns for immigrants, as it does for the native-born.},

Examining the childbearing behaviour of Polish women, this study extends previous research by combining information from the countries of origin and of destination. Using retrospective data from Poland (derived from the European Social Survey) and Britain (derived from the Labour Force Survey), discrete-time event history methods are applied to study the transition to a ﬁrst birth in relation to the timing of migration.

Men of the first and subsequent migrant generations are compared with “stayers” from the same regions of origin in Turkey. We pay special attention to the men’s reasons for migration by distinguishing between work and nonwork motivations for migration. We use data from the 2000 Families Study, which was conducted in 2010 and 2011 in Turkey and in western European countries; the sample consists of about 3,500 men. We analyze the transitions to fatherhood as well as to second and third births using event-history analyses; and we investigate the cumulated number of children using Poisson regression analysis. As the men were aged 18–92 at the data collection, we carry out separate models for birth cohort groups. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of the interrelatedness of events. First-generation migrant men show elevated first birth transitions, which are closely linked to marriage and migration. However, in contrast to the pattern that is often found for women, this effect is observed for labor as well as for nonwork migrants. The rates of transition to a second and a third birth differ less from those of stayers. Analyses of cumulated fertility at age 41 or older further suggest that the migrants’ overall numbers of children are smaller than those of the stayers in Turkey. Thus, our findings indicate that there are dissimilation processes and crossover trends among emigrant men characterized by higher rates of transition to family formation linked to migration but lower overall fertility.},

Unlike previous assimilation studies that focus on integration into the destination society, this study emphasizes the dynamic nature of the assimilation process by modeling the declining impact of the origin cultural setting. Although part of the variability among immigrant groups can be attributed to compositional differences, sending-country fertility levels continue to exert a positive influence on immigrant fertility behavior. However, this influence is considerably weaker among immigrants who are positively selected with respect to their sending-country populations, presumably because they adapt more rapidly to the destination society. Additional evidence suggests that in general, as immigrants adapt to the U.S., they are less and less influenced by their origin social environments.},

Moreover, shortterm fertility-lowering-eﬀects of residential relocation have also been proposed and challenged in the literature. This paper contributes to the existing discussion by providing an analysis of the eﬀect of internal migration on fertility of post-war Estonian female cohorts. We use retrospective event-history data and apply intensity regression for both single and simultaneous equations. Our analysis shows that ﬁrst, the risk of birth for native residents decreases with increasing settlement size and the decrease is larger for higher-order parities. Second, it shows that migrants, whatever their origin, exhibit fertility levels similar to those of nonmigrants at destination. We also observe elevated fertility levels after residential relocations arising from union formation. Our further analysis supports the adaptation hypothesis. We ﬁnd no evidence on (strong) selectivity of migrants by fertility preferences.},

Two theoretical approaches guide our analyses. First, it is expected that the family of origin may push migrants in a more conservative direction. Second, it is expected that aspects of individual achievement in social, cultural and socioeconomic domains may pull migrants in more liberal directions. We find that Moroccan and Turkish migrants have considerably more conservative values about marriage and sexuality than natives, but there is also variation within the second generation. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses for migrants indicate that the role of parents is particularly important: migrant children of religiously more orthodox parents and children of parents who were poorly integrated socially and culturally in their youth, currently have more conservative values about marriage and sexuality, even when individual characteristics are controlled for. Of the various aspects of individual achievement, we find that especially social integration of the second generation is a relevant predictor of liberal values, and not socioeconomic indicators of integration. These results remain significant in a stringent longitudinal test which minimises the bias due to reverse causation.},

	abstract = {Reflecting a growing concern with high rates of urban growth in less developed countries, increasing attention focuses on the fertility of migrants to such places. The present study explores the relations between fertility, migration, and urbanization, using `own children' data from the 1970 Census of Thailand. Information on `own children' less than one year old is used to approximate fertility levels in the year before the census, and that on `own children' aged 1-4 fertility levels during the four preceding years. Since migration was defined as a move to current residence between 1965 and 1970, the statistics on `own children' less than five years old allow scrutiny of fertility during the period immediately before and after migration. Controlling for a variety of socio-economic characteristics of currently married women aged 20-49, and using several analytical approaches, the current fertility of migrants was consistently found to be higher than their own earlier fertility and higher than that of non-migrants in urban areas. Conversely, past fertility of migrants was lower than that of non-migrants, and past fertility levels of non-migrants were generally as high as current levels. The statistics thus suggest that migration is either selective of women with low fertility and/or that the migration process itself disrupts childbearing. Once the migrant women have moved, a `catch-up' effect seems to operate to raise current fertility levels, but the cumulative fertility of migrants remains below that of non-migrants.},

We calculate two types of fertility rates for each year in 1961–1999: (i) rates that are based on the population that was living in Sweden at the end of 1999, and (ii) rates that also include information on people who had died or emigrated before the turn of the twentieth century. We ﬁnd that the omission of information on individuals who had emigrated or died, as the situation would be in any demographic survey, most often have negligible effects on fertility measures. However, ﬁrst-birth rates of immigrants gradually become more biased as we move back in time from 1999 so that they increasingly tend to over-estimate the true fertility of that population.},

The stationarity of the native population, among which deaths exceed births, is maintained by the compensating number of births to the immigrant population.

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive theory for the demographic analysis of populations in which individuals are classified by both age and stage. The earliest demographic models were age classified. Ecologists adopted methods developed by human demographers and used life tables to quantify survivorship and fertility of cohorts and the growth rates and structures of populations. Later, motivated by studies of plants and insects, matrix population models structured by size or stage were developed. The theory of these models has been extended to cover all the aspects of age-classified demography and more. It is a natural development to consider populations classified by both age and stage. A steady trickle of results has appeared since the 1960s, analyzing one or another aspect of age × stage-classified populations, in both ecology and human demography. Here, we use the vec-permutation formulation of multistate matrix population models to incorporate age- and stage-specific vital rates into demographic analysis. We present cohort results for the life table functions (survivorship, mortality, and fertility), the dynamics of intra-cohort selection, the statistics of longevity, the joint distribution of age and stage at death, and the statistics of life disparity. Combining transitions and fertility yields a complete set of population dynamic results, including population growth rates and structures, net reproductive rate, the statistics of lifetime reproduction, and measures of generation time. We present a complete analysis of a hypothetical model species, inspired by poecilogonous marine invertebrates that produce two kinds of larval offspring. Given the joint effects of age and stage, many familiar demographic results become multidimensional, so calculations of marginal and mixture distributions are an important tool. From an age-classified point of view, stage structure is a form of unobserved heterogeneity. From a stage-classified point of view, age structure is unobserved heterogeneity. In an age × stage-classified model, variance in demographic outcomes can be partitioned into contributions from both sources. Because these models are formulated as matrices, they are amenable to a complete sensitivity analysis. As more detailed and longer longitudinal studies are developed, age × stage-classified demography will become more common and more important.},

An average net migration of 100,000 persons per year would result in a projected decline in the labour force of 9 million by 2060. An extremely high migration of at least 400,000 persons would allow the potential labour force to remain roughly constant.

	abstract = {Demographic models describe population dynamics in terms of the movement of individuals among states (e.g. size, age, developmental stage, parity, frailty, physiological condition). Matrix population models originally classified individuals by a single characteristic. This was enlarged to two characteristics in vec-permutation models and the closely related megamatrix models. However, it has been recognised that the interplay of more than two characteristics can affect the population dynamics. Here, we present a framework, called hyperstate matrix model, in which individuals may be classified by any number of characteristics, using the generalisation of the vec-permutation approach to hypermatrices. These models are constructed from a simple block-diagonal matrix formulation of the movement of individuals among each dimension of the i-state. This framework provides a step-by-step construction and makes available the usual demographic analysis developed for classical matrix models. In particular, we derive a general formula for the sensitivity of any output of the hyperstate matrix model, to any vector of parameters. In spite of the technicalities underlying these models, implementation is straightforward and we provide the {MATLAB} code to carry it out. We apply this approach to a three-dimensional example in which individuals are classified by developmental stage, age and heterogeneity classes. The analysis of this model provides insights into how the heritability of the heterogeneity classes affects the long-term growth rate of the population. As the questions in conservation biology become more sophisticated and data on threatened species become more detailed, multiple dimensions in demographic models will become increasingly important. Hyperstate matrix methods will make such analyses possible and directly applicable to conservation and population management.},

To address this question, a mortality analysis for the years 1890 to 1995 was performed comparing mortality data on more than 11,000 Catholic nuns and monks in Bavarian communities living in very nearly identical behavioral and environmental conditions with life table data for the general German population. While the mortality differences between women and men in the general German population increased considerably after World War {II}, they remained almost constant among the members of Bavarian religious orders during the entire observation period, with slight advantages for nuns. Thus, the higher differences observable in the general population cannot be attributed to biological factors. The different trends in sex-specific mortality between the general and the cloistered populations are caused exclusively by men in the general population who were unable to follow the trend in mortality reduction of women, nuns, and especially monks. Under the special environmental conditions of nuns and monks, biological factors appear to confer a maximum survival advantage for women of no more than one year in remaining life expectancy at young adult ages.},

We hypothesise that they are to a large extent caused by specific subpopulations of men with particularly high mortality levels that decrease the average life expectancy of men. \textbf{\textit{Methods:}} To test this hypothesis, we investigate in a meta-analysis the variability in mortality ({VM}) in women and men - defined as the range of death rates prevailing among subpopulations - in empirical studies analysing specific phenomena of mortality differentials. We used the data of 72 empirical studies, including 146 total effects ({TE}) and 1,718 single effects ({SE}) for 21 different risk factors. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} In 85\% of {TE} and three quarters of {SE} the {VM} was higher in men than in women, taking into account men's higher overall mortality. The corresponding figures for the direct differences in the {VM} between women and men are 92 and 82\%, respectively. Cases with higher female {VM} are rare exceptions and appear in particular in the highest age groups. \textbf{\textit{Conclusions:}} We find support for our hypothesis that the disproportionate high mortality levels of specific male subpopulations are the central cause of the current extent of sex differences in life expectancy. Thus, public health programmes should be targeted toward these disadvantaged subpopulations among men which seem to be related primarily to socioeconomic characteristics.},

            This article demonstrates that over the period 1948–2003, sex differences in mortality in the age range 50–84 widened and then narrowed on a cohort basis rather than on a period basis. The cohort with the maximum excess of male mortality was born shortly after the turn of the century. Three separate data sources suggest that the turnaround in sex mortality differences is consistent with sex differences in cigarette smoking by cohort. An age-period-cohort model reveals a highly significant effect of smoking histories on men’s and women’s mortality. Combined with recent changes in smoking patterns, the model suggests that sex differences in mortality will narrow dramatically in coming decades.},

The aim of the present study is to fill this gap by providing estimates for differences in {LE} by education, household income, work status and vocational class. The lack of national mortality data by {SEP} required an innovative methodological approach to estimate {LE} from survey data with a mortality follow-up. The main strengths of the method are the low demand on the data, its simple applicability and the estimation of a set of age-specific probabilities of dying. We employed the method to the German Life Expectancy Survey and estimated period life tables for 45 male and 32 female {SEP} subpopulations. The results show striking differences in {LE} across all analysed {SEP} indicators. Among men, {LE} at age 40 ranges by more than five years between the lowest and highest household income quartiles, more than six years between individuals with low and high education, around ten years across the work status groups, and almost 15 years across the vocational classes. The proportion of those who reach the classic pension age of 65 years also varies considerably, as does the remaining {LE} at this age. The corresponding differences among women are smaller, yet still notable. The results yield an interesting finding for the ongoing discussion about the various consequences of an increased pension age. Moreover, they provide policy-makers, doctors, researchers and public health workers with insights into Germany’s most disadvantaged {SEP} subpopulations and the potential extent of their disadvantages in terms of longevity and mortality.},

The Trivers-Willard hypothesis, for instance, suggests that mothers with different qualities (size, health, etc.) will use different sex ratios if maternal quality differentially affects sex-specific reproductive success. Condition-dependent, or facultative, sex ratio strategies like these allow multiple sex ratios to coexist within a population. They also create complex population structure due to the presence of multiple maternal conditions. As a result, modeling facultative sex ratio evolution requires not only sex ratio strategies with multiple components, but also two-sex population models with explicit stage structure. To this end, we combine nonlinear, frequency-dependent matrix models and multidimensional adaptive dynamics to create a new framework for studying sex ratio evolution. We illustrate the applications of this framework with two case studies where the sex ratios depend one of two possible maternal conditions (age or quality). In these cases, we identify evolutionarily singular sex ratio strategies, find instances where one maternal condition produces exclusively male or female offspring, and show that sex ratio biases depend on the relative reproductive value ratios for each sex.},

	abstract = {Objective  To measure sex differences in lifespan based on the probability of males to outlive females. Design  International comparison of national and regional sex-­specific life tables from the Human Mortality Database and the World Population Prospects. Setting  199 populations spanning all continents, between 1751 and 2020. Primary outcome measure  We used the outsurvival statistic (‍φ‍) to measure inequality in lifespan between sexes, which is interpreted here as the probability of males to outlive females.
Results  In random pairs of one male and one female at age 0, the probability of the male outliving the female varies between 25\% and 50\% for life tables in almost all years since 1751 and across almost all populations. We show that ‍φ‍is negatively correlated with sex differences in life expectancy and positively correlated with the level of lifespan variation. The important reduction of lifespan inequality observed in recent years has made it less likely for a male to outlive a female.
Conclusions  Although male life expectancy is generally lower than female life expectancy, and male death rates are usually higher at all ages, males have a substantial chance of outliving females. These findings challenge the general impression that ‘men do not live as long as women’ and reveal a more nuanced inequality in lifespans between females and males.},

As an update to Winship \& Morgan's (1999) earlier review, the article summarizes the more recent literature that is characterized by a broader range of estimands of interest, a renewed interest in exploiting experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and important progress in the areas of semi- and nonparametric estimation of treatment effects, difference-in-differences estimation, and instrumental variable estimation. The review concludes by highlighting implications of the recent econometric and statistical literature for sociological research practice.},

	abstract = {Although published works rarely include causal estimates from more than a few model specifications, authors usually choose the presented estimates from numerous trial runs readers never see. Given the often large variation in estimates across choices of control variables, functional forms, and other modeling assumptions, how can researchers ensure that the few estimates presented are accurate or representative? How do readers know that publications are not merely demonstrations that it is
              possible
              to find a specification that fits the author's favorite hypothesis? And how do we evaluate or even define statistical properties like unbiasedness or mean squared error when no unique model or estimator even exists? Matching methods, which offer the promise of causal inference with fewer assumptions, constitute one possible way forward, but crucial results in this fast-growing methodological literature are often grossly misinterpreted. We explain how to avoid these misinterpretations and propose a unified approach that makes it possible for researchers to preprocess data with matching (such as with the easy-to-use software we offer) and then to apply the best parametric techniques they would have used anyway. This procedure makes parametric models produce more accurate and considerably less model-dependent causal inferences.},

	abstract = {Objective This article provides an assessment of whether unmarried women currently face demographic shortages of marital partners in the U.S. marriage market. Background One explanation for the declines in marriage is the putative shortage of economically attractive partners for unmarried women to marry. Previous studies provide mixed results but are usually focused narrowly on sex ratio imbalances rather than identifying shortages on the multiple socioeconomic characteristics that typically sort women and men into marriages. Methods This study identifies recent marriages from the 2008 to 2012 and 2013 to 2017 cumulative 5-year files of the American Community Survey. Data imputation methods provide estimates of the sociodemographic characteristics of unmarried women's potential (or synthetic) spouses who resemble the husbands of otherwise comparable married women. These estimates are compared with the actual distribution of unmarried men at the national, state, and local area levels to identify marriage market imbalances. Results These synthetic husbands have an average income that is about 58\% higher than the actual unmarried men that are currently available to unmarried women. They also are 30\% more likely to be employed (90\% vs. 70\%) and 19\% more likely to have a college degree (30\% vs. 25\%). Racial and ethnic minorities, especially Black women, face serious shortages of potential marital partners, as do low socioeconomic status and high socioeconomic status unmarried women, both at the national and subnational levels. Conclusions This study reveals large deficits in the supply of potential male spouses. One implication is that the unmarried may remain unmarried or marry less well-suited partners.},

These methods allow us to calculate the distribution of the occupation time in a subset of the state space, the distribution of the waiting time to first entry into a subset of the state space, and the distribution of the waiting time to final exit from a subset of the state space. To demonstrate the usefulness of these methods, we apply them to working life tables for Spanish males to assess how the recent financial crisis affected the length of working life. The results show that the duration of working life decreased considerably, a pattern that can largely be explained by later entry to and earlier exit from the labor market. The findings also indicate that inequality in the length of working life increased.},

	abstract = {Background: Markov models are a key tool for calculating expected time spent in a state, such as active life expectancy and disabled life expectancy. In reality, individuals often enter and exit states recurrently, but standard analytical approaches are not able to describe this dynamic. We develop an analytical matrix approach to calculating the expected number and length of episodes spent in a state.
Methods: The approach we propose is based on Markov chains with rewards. It allows us to identify the number of entries into a state and to calculate the average length of episodes as total time in a state divided by the number of entries. For sampling variance estimation, we employ the block bootstrap. Two case studies that are based on published literature illustrate how our methods can provide new insights into disability dynamics.
Results: The first application uses a classic textbook example on prednisone treatment and liver functioning among liver cirrhosis patients. We replicate well-known results of no association between treatment and survival or recovery. Our analysis of the episodes of normal liver functioning delivers the new insight that the treatment reduced the likelihood of relapse and extended episodes of normal liver functioning. The second application assesses frailty and disability among elderly people. We replicate the prior finding that frail individuals have longer life expectancy in disability. As a novel finding, we document that frail individuals experience three times as many episodes of disability that were on average twice as long as the episodes of nonfrail individuals.
Conclusions: We provide a simple analytical approach for calculating the number and length of episodes in Markov chain models. The results allow a description of the transition dynamics that goes beyond the results that can be obtained using standard tools for Markov chains. Empirical applications using published data illustrate how the new method is helpful in unraveling the dynamics of the modeled process.},

Accordingly, data obtained from families of completed fertility in six probability samples of metropolitan Detroit are divided into two groups, farm migrants and two-generation urbanites. In general, the socio-economic differences in fertility observed among the "pure" urban types in Detroit are found to be small and inconsistent, most of them being statistically insignificant. The inverse fertility pattern found in the total Detroit population is attributed to: (a) the overrepresentation of farm migrants (who have high fertility) in the lowest social and economic positions in the city, and (b) the pronounced inverse pattern of fertility among the farm migrants. It is suggested that the absence of an inverse fertility pattern among two-generation urbanites and its presence among the farm migrants can be attributed to differences in family organization.},

Two major reasons may account for lower fertility levels observed among such migrants than among women who remained in rural areas: a selection effect, and adaptation to constraints in the area of destination. Results of previous studies have only rarely suggested that the effect of adaptation was significant. We use the detailed personal migration and pregnancy histories recorded in the Korean World Fertility Survey of 1974 and an autoregressive model to control for unobservable variations in personal preferences for different family sizes between migrants and non-migrants. Our study provides evidence that adaptation following rural-urban migration is a significant factor which explains the lower fertility of rural-urban migrants compared with that of rural stayers.},

In the absence of longitudinal or life history data, the kinds of forces affecting immigrant group fertility can be inferred by: 1) examining the degree to which Mexican-origin women disaggregated by nativity or generational groups differ in fertility behavior from non-Hispanic Whites; 2) analyzing both current and cumulative fertility; 3) comparing the fertility of nativity or generational groups disaggregated by age of women and period of immigration; and 4) conducting cohort analyses between more than one time period. The findings show evidence of both assimilation and disruption effects on reproductive behavior. Fertility is found to decline the greater the length of familial exposure to the United States and, in the case of younger groups of immigrant women, to fall below the level of U.S.-born Mexican-origin and non-Hispanic White women when other variables are held constant. These results illustrate why assimilation effects on immigrant group fertility have often not emerged in previous research. They also imply that the fertility behavior of the Mexican-origin population is likely to come to resemble that of the rest of the population the longer this group resides in the United States.},

	abstract = {The fertility behaviour of migrants is often studied by examining migrants and native nonmigrants in the country of destination. To understand the mechanisms for migrant fertility, it is important to know what distinguishes them from the population they originate from. The Ghanaian sample of the 'Migrations between Africa and Europe' project allows us to contrast the fertility of those who never emigrated from Ghana and Ghanaian migrants who are residing in the {UK} or the Netherlands. First, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first birth to evaluate whether first birth timing is influenced by migration. Second, we apply Poisson regression techniques to examine differentials in completed fertility. We find that Ghanaian migrants postpone first childbirth compared with nonmigrants. Differences are largest at ages 20 to 24 for women and 20 to 29 for men. Ghana experiences a typical brain drain, which means that especially the highly skilled emigrate. In our sample, this is particularly true for women. Education seems to be an important determinant of the postponement of first childbirth in Ghana, although we cannot clearly attribute migrants' later first births to their higher level of education. However, our findings on completed fertility reveal that migrants have fewer children than nonmigrants and this difference diminishes considerably if we take into account their level of education. Apparently, migrants do not fully catch up after postponing first childbirth and end up with a lower number of children by the age of 40.},

Three approaches to forecasting demographic processes are extrapolation, expectation (individual-level birth expectations or population-level opinions of experts), and theory-based structural modelling involving exogenous variables. Models include 0–3 factors (age, period and cohort). Decomposition and disaggregation are also used in multistate models, including macrosimulation and microsimulation. Forecasting demographic change is difficult; accuracy depends on the particular situation or trends, but it is not clear when a method will perform best. Estimates of uncertainty (model-based ex ante error, expert-opinion-based ex ante error, and ex post error) differ; uncertainty estimation is highly uncertain. Probabilistic population forecasts are based on stochastic population renewal or random scenarios. The approaches to population forecasting, demographic process forecasting and error estimation are closely linked. Complementary methods that combine approaches are increasingly employed. The paper summarises developments, assesses progress and considers the future.},

We integrate the literature on the effect of the reversed gender gap in education on educational assortative mating, with a focus on mating dynamics and the measurement of the partner market over the life course. We concentrate on two particular educational groups, low-educated men and highly educated women, those with worsening mating prospects and more subject to experience hypogamous unions. Our results show that the local education-specific mating squeeze influences union formation, its timing, and educational sorting. Indeed, for the two groups, the increasing supply of highly educated women in the partner market increases the likelihood of remaining single or establishing an hypogamous union, where she is higher educated than he. In line with search theory, we find the effects of the mating squeeze to become particularly visible after people turn 30 years of age. This is true for the risk of remaining single and forming an hypogamous union. We underline the necessity to study assortative mating and union formation from a dynamic perspective, taking into account changing structural conditions during the partner search process.},

            This paper reports trends in educational assortative marriage from 1940 to 2003 in the United States. Analyses of census and Current Population Survey data show that educational homogamy decreased from 1940 to 1960 but increased from 1960 to 2003. From 1960 to the early 1970s, increases in educational homogamy were generated by decreasing intermarriage among groups of relatively well-educated persons. College graduates, in particular, were increasingly likely to marry each other rather than those with less education. Beginning in the early 1970s, however, continued increases in the odds of educational homogamy were generated by decreases in intermarriage at both ends of the education distribution. Most striking is the decline in the odds that those with very low levels of education marry up. Intermarriage between college graduates and those with “some college” continued to decline but at a more gradual pace. As intermarriage declined at the extremes of the education distribution, intermarriage among those in the middle portion of the distribution increased. These trends, which are similar for a broad cross section of married couples and for newlyweds, are consistent with a growing social divide between those with very low levels of education and those with more education in the United States.},

In 1996 the {UN} declared Sweden to be the most gender-equal country in the world. However, women still take much more responsibility for children and domestic work than men do, leading to the reproduction of gender inequality in the labour market and in society at large. A causal mechanism is used to analyse this phenomenon, starting from the observation that men are on average three years older than women and thus already have a stronger position on the labour market when a heterosexual couple is formed. This increases the risk that the woman will lose the first negotiations on how to divide household and wage labour when they have children. This will in turn lead to increasing returns for the man, increasing the risk that she will lose subsequent negotiations about the division of labour. What seems to be a rational arrangement for both (increasing the total income for the family) results in the reproduction of gender inequality. The analysis shows that gender inequality in a country like Sweden is reproduced behind the backs of the agents.},

	title = {The Economics of Fertility: A New Era},
	abstract = {The Economics of Fertility: A New Era* In this survey, we argue that the economic analysis of fertility has entered a new era. First-generation models of fertility choice were designed to account for two empirical regularities that, in the past, held both across countries and across families in a given country: a negative relationship between income and fertility, and another negative relationship between women’s labor force participation and fertility. The economics of fertility has entered a new era because these stylized facts no longer universally hold. In high-income countries, the income-fertility relationship has flattened and in some cases reversed, and the cross-country relationship between women’s labor force participation and fertility is now positive. We summarize these new facts and describe new models that are designed to address them. The common theme of these new theories is that they view factors that determine the compatibility of women’s career and family goals as key drivers of fertility. We highlight four factors that facilitate combining a career with a family: family policy, cooperative fathers, favorable social norms, and flexible labor markets. We also review other recent developments in the literature, and we point out promising new directions for future research on the economics of fertility.},

While there is a large body of literature on various aspects of immigrant lives in Europe, research on family dynamics has emerged only in the last decade. Studies based on individual-level longitudinal data and disaggregated measures of partnership and fertility behaviour have signiﬁcantly advanced our understanding of the factors shaping family patterns among immigrants and their descendants and have contributed to research on immigrant integration. By drawing on recent research, this paper proposes several ways of further developing research on ethnic minority families. We emphasise the need to study family changes among immigrants and their descendants over their life courses, investigate various modes of family behaviour and conduct more truly comparative research to deepen our understanding of how ethnic minorities structure their family lives in different institutional and policy settings.},

	shorttitle = {One Hundred Years of Migration Discourse in The Times},
	abstract = {This study proposes an experimental method to trace the historical evolution of media discourse as a means to investigate the construction of collective meaning. Based on distributional semantics theory (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957) and critical discourse theory (Wodak and Fairclough, 1997), it explores the value of merging two techniques widely employed to investigate language and meaning in two separate fields: neural word embeddings (computational linguistics) and the discourse-historical approach ({DHA}; Reisigl and Wodak, 2001) (applied linguistics). As a use case, we investigate the historical changes in the semantic space of public discourse of migration in the United Kingdom, and we use the Times Digital Archive ({TDA}) from 1900 to 2000 as dataset. For the computational part, we use the publicly available {TDA} word2vec models1 (Kenter et al., 2015; Martinez-Ortiz et al., 2016); these models have been trained according to sliding time windows with the specific intention to map conceptual change. We then use {DHA} to triangulate the results generated by the word vector models with social and historical data to identify plausible explanations for the changes in the public debate. By bringing the focus of the analysis to the level of discourse, with this method, we aim to go beyond mapping different senses expressed by single words and to add the currently missing sociohistorical and sociolinguistic depth to the computational results. The study rests on the foundation that social changes will be reflected in changes in public discourse (Couldry, 2008). Although correlation does not prove direct causation, we argue that historical events, language, and meaning should be considered as a mutually reinforcing cycle in which the language used to describe events shapes explicit meanings, which in turn trigger other events, which again will be reflected in the public discourse.},

Migrants are generally under-represented and shown as delinquents or criminals. Although, media framing diﬀers based on speciﬁc migrant groups the discourse is focusing on, immigration coverage is often negative and conﬂict-centred. Frequent exposure to such media messages leads to negative attitudes towards migration, may activate stereotypical cognitions of migrant groups, and even inﬂuence vote choice.

Based on cluster analyses, we found that the salience of family in sociability practices and solidarity norms to a signiﬁcant extent varies according to welfare regimes. Individuals from a Mediterranean welfare regime more often develop a pattern of sociability by a focus on children or parents. Normatively, they develop a pattern stressing the salience of both family and state. Individuals from a corporatist welfare regime more often develop a pattern of sociability focused on extended kin or feature a lack of sociability. At the normative level, they promote either the patterns of state support or reliance on the self. Individuals from a liberal welfare regime stress patterns of family support or self-reliance at the normative level. They develop a pattern of associational activity or show a lack of sociability. Individuals from social-democratic welfare regimes are more frequently normatively oriented toward state support while promoting participation in associations or showing a lack in their sociability.},

What remains to be examined is the variation among regimes in the social mechanisms regulating these transfers. Using data from the first wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ({SHARE}), this article shows that financial transfers have different aims and meanings across the regimes. In Southern Europe, parents support their children mainly through co-residence, and little economic support passes the walls of the house. In the Nordic countries, in contrast, parent–child co-residence is non-normative. Children leave their parents’ home early and then receive direct and explicit help from them. The Continental countries fall in-between.},

About 70\% of studies focused on the United States, while the remaining 30\% focused on other industrialized Western societies.
Results: We identified three general processes by which alternative family forms are created and discussed how kinship practices work in each of them. The first cluster of alternative family forms comes about through variations of formal marriage or its absence, including sequential marriages, plural marriages, consensual unions, single parenthood, and same-sex marriages and partnerships. The second cluster is formed as a result of alterations in the reproduction process, when a child is not the product of sexual intercourse between two people. The third cluster results from the formation of voluntary bonds that are deemed to be kinship-like, in which affiliation rests on neither biological nor legal bases.
Conclusion: Findings from this study point to a broad cultural acceptance of an inclusive approach to incorporating potential kin in “family relationships.” It is largely left to individuals to decide whether they recognize or experience},

	abstract = {Racial disparity in family incomes remained remarkably stable over the past 40 years in the United States despite major legal and social reforms. Previous scholarship presents two primary explanations for persistent inequality through a period of progressive change. One highlights continuity: because socioeconomic status is transmitted from parents to children, disparities created through histories of discrimination and opportunity denial may dissipate slowly. The second highlights change: because family income results from joining individual earnings in family units, changing family compositions can offset individuals’ changing economic chances. I examine whether black-white family income inequality trends are better characterized by the persistence of existing disadvantage (continuity) or shifting forms of disadvantage (change). I combine cross-sectional and panel analysis using Current Population Survey, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Census, and National Vital Statistics data. Results suggest that African Americans experience relatively extreme intergenerational continuity (low upward mobility) and discontinuity (high downward mobility); both helped maintain racial inequality. Yet, intergenerational discontinuities allow new forms of disadvantage to emerge. On net, racial inequality trends are better characterized by changing forms of disadvantage than by continuity. Economic trends were equalizing but demographic trends were disequalizing; as family structures shifted, family incomes did not fully reflect labormarket gains.},

	abstract = {Whereas the extended family plays a central role in many models of economic behavior, particularly in developing countries, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the extent and nature of resource sharing among non coresident family members. This is in sharp contrast with abundant evidence that the distribution of resources within households predicts household spending and savings patterns. To ﬁll this gap, the collective model of household decision-making is extended to the family. The model is particularly appealing in this context because it places few restrictions on preferences of individual family members who may or may not be coresident and does not specify a speciﬁc bargaining mechanism that underlies negotiations. The model yields empirical tests of whether the behavior of family members is (Pareto) eﬃcient.},

This essay mentions a series of studies supported by the {MacArthur} Foundation Research Network on an Aging Society that aim to examine the future of intergenerational exchange. We focus particularly on adults who have dependent and young-adult children and who must also care for elderly parents, a fraction of the population that will grow substantially in the coming twenty-½ve years.},

Here, we report data from 10,526 participants in {HurryDate} sessions, in which roughly 25 men and 25 women interacted with each other for three minutes and subsequently indicated which of the people they met they would be interested in having contact with in the future. We had general survey information collected by {HurryDate} for all the participants and additional survey information for 2,650 participants. Our main findings are that (1) {HurryDate} interactions are driven primarily by generally agreed-upon mate values and less by niche-based or assortative patterns, (2) the agreed-upon mate values for both men and women derive almost exclusively from physically observable attributes like attractiveness, {BMI}, height, and age and are not substantially related to harder-to-observe attributes such as education, religion, sociosexuality, having children, or desiring future children, and (3) small positive assortative trends arise in the areas of race and height. Our results provide rare behavioral evidence regarding people’s preferences in dating partners.},

Consistent with previous findings, women preferred partners of their own age, regardless of their own age and regardless of the level of relationship involvement. Men, on the other hand, regardless of their own age, desired mates for short-term mating and for sexual fantasies who were in their reproductive years. However, with regard to long-term mates, men preferred mates who, although younger than them, were sometimes above the age of maximum fertility. Explanations for these findings are discussed.

We document heterogeneity across countries in how the marriage gap for skilled women has evolved over time. As labor market opportunities for women have improved, the marriage gap has been growing in some countries but shrinking in others. We discuss a theoretical model in which the (negative) social attitudes towards working women might contribute towards the lower marriage rate of skilled women, and might also induce a non-linear relationship between their labor market prospects and their marriage outcomes. The model is suited to understand the dynamics of the marriage gap for skilled women over time within a country with set social attitudes towards working women. The model also delivers predictions about how the marriage gap for skilled women should react to changes in their labor market opportunities across countries with more or less conservative attitudes towards working women. We test the key predictions of this model in a panel of 23 developed countries, as well as in a panel of {US} states.},

In this article, we examine the relationship between educational assortative mating and income inequality in Denmark between 1987 and 2006. Denmark is widely known for its low level of income inequality, but the Danish case provides a good test of the relationship between educational assortative mating and inequality because although income inequality increased over the period we consider, educational homogamy declined. Using register data on the exact incomes of the whole population, we find that change in assortative mating increased income inequality but that these changes were driven by changes in the educational distributions of men and women rather than in the propensity for people to choose a partner with a given level of education.},

Explanations have typi­­cally cent­ered on assortative mati­ng, but recent work has argued that changes in women’s employm­ ent and spouses’ divis­ion of paid work have played a more import­ant role. We expand this work to cons­ ider the criti­­cal turni­ng point of pare­ nt­hood in shap­ing coup­ les’ divis­ ion of employm­ ent and earni­ngs. Drawing on three U.S. nationa­ lly repr­ e­sen­tat­ive surv­ eys, we exam­ine the role of pare­ nt­hood in spouses’ earni­ngs corr­ e­la­tions between 1968 and 2015. We exami­ne the extent to which changes in spouses’ earni­ngs cor­re­la­tions are due to (1) changes upon entry into marr­iage (assortative mati­ng), (2) changes between mar­riage and pare­ nt­hood, (3) changes foll­ow­ing pare­ nt­hood, and (4) changes in women’s employ­ment. Our find­ings show that increases in the cor­re­la­tion between spouses’ earni­ngs prior to 1990 came largely from changes between marr­iage and first birth, but increases after 1990 came almost entirely from changes foll­ow­ing par­ent­hood. In both instances, changes in women’s employm­ ent are key to increasi­ng earni­ngs corr­ el­a­tions. Changes in assortative mati­ng played litt­le role in either period. An assessm­ ent of the aggre­gate-level implic­ a­tions points to the growi­ng sign­ if­ic­ ance of earni­ngs simi­l­ar­ity after pare­ nth­ ood for ris­ing income inequali­ty across fami­­lies.},

Quantitative Social Science engages directly with empirical analysis, showing students how to analyze data using the R programming language and to interpret the results--it encourages hands-on learning, not paper-and-pencil statistics. More than forty data sets taken directly from leading quantitative social science research illustrate how data analysis can be used to answer important questions about society and human behavior. Proven in the classroom, this one-of-a-kind textbook features numerous additional data analysis exercises and interactive R programming exercises, and also comes with supplementary teaching materials for instructors. --},

In this study, we used a representative sample of contemporary Swedish men and women to analyze possible reasons for the contradictory results. We found that the relationship between socioeconomic status—described here by income and highest educational level attained—and reproductive output is dependent on sex and the inclusion or exclusion of childless individuals. In men, there is a strong positive association between income/education and average offspring count if childless individuals are included in the analysis; this association is absent when such individuals are excluded. We attribute this reversal mainly to the higher proportion of childless individuals among men of lower socioeconomic background. Among other factors, female choice appears to be a major cause of this association because the proportion of men who never married increased with decreasing income category and educational level. In women, however, including and excluding childless individuals both yielded a negative association between income and average offspring count as well as a null or negative relationship between education and average offspring count.},

	shorttitle = {Family and fertility},
	abstract = {Despite the tendency of some academic disciplines to assume that the nuclear family is normative, the family takes a number of different forms cross-culturally. Regardless of family form, family members typically cooperate in raising children. Intergenerational help (from grandparents to parents and children), for example, is a cross-cultural universal. Such cooperation means that the availability of kin may be one salient factor in deciding whether and when to have children. Here I consider the evidence for whether the availability of kin does influence fertility, and whether these relationships vary cross-culturally. I find evidence from middle and lower income populations that the presence of kin does increase fertility, and that these relationships are plausibly driven by cooperation between family members. In higher income contexts, associations between kin and fertility are mixed, and appear particularly sensitive to how kin availability and support is measured. There is some evidence that certain measures of support from kin (such as emotional support or help with childcare) increases the likelihood of subsequent births, but kin support is not always positively associated with fertility. Family matters for fertility, then, though these relationships may be complex and context-specific. Policy needs to take this diversity into account, and should not focus exclusively on the nuclear family model, nor neglect the roles other family members play in reproductive decisions.},

	abstract = {The ‘generational contract’ is the most important and also the most contentious dimension of contemporary welfare systems. Much of the debate on how to reform it is still truncated, however, by focusing on its public dimension only, especially on pensions and health-care provisions. For a full account, the transfer of resources between adult generations in the family needs to be included as well. So far, research on family transfers has almost exclusively been limited to singlecountry studies. In this article, we present a comparative study of financial transfers and social support in ten Western European countries based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ({SHARE}) conducted in 2004. Our results confirm, at the European level, the existence of a common transfer pattern. There is a net downward flow from the older to the younger generations, both by inter vivos financial transfers and by social support. Transfers from the elderly parents to their children are much more frequent and also usually much more intense than those in the opposite direction. The positive balance decreases with age but even those over the age of 70 clearly remain net givers. Our results also demonstrate that country-specific transfer patterns follow the typology of welfare regimes. Transfers from parents to children are less frequent but more intense in the Southern European countries than in the Nordic ones, with the Continental European countries being somewhere in between the two. This welfare regime effect still holds after controlling for the most relevant characteristics of the parents.},

This paper constructs a data set of 835,537 linked father–son pairs from census records and documents a substantial increase in intergenerational occupational mobility in Norway between 1865 and 2011. The increase is most pronounced in non-farm occupations. The findings show that long-run mobility developments previously described for the {US} and {UK} are not necessarily representative for other countries, and that high mobility in a given country today need not reflect high mobility before industrialization.},

	abstract = {The study of intergenerational mobility and most population research are governed by a two-generation (parent-to-offspring) view of intergenerational influence, to the neglect of the effects of grandparents and other ancestors and nonresident contemporary kin. While appropriate for some populations in some periods, this perspective may omit important sources of intergenerational continuity of family-based social inequality. Social institutions, which transcend individual lives, help support multigenerational influence, particularly at the extreme top and bottom of the social hierarchy, but to some extent in the middle as well. Multigenerational influence also works through demographic processes because families influence subsequent generations through differential fertility and survival, migration, and marriage patterns, as well as through direct transmission of socioeconomic rewards, statuses, and positions. Future research should attend more closely to multigenerational effects; to the tandem nature of demographic and socioeconomic reproduction; and to data, measures, and models that transcend coresident nuclear families.},

	abstract = {Western societies are ageing rapidly. Today people do not only live longer, they also have fewer children. These developments exert considerable pressure on welfare states. Children have usually been the mainstay of old age support, especially when there is no partner. We thus face new challenges: On which support networks can a growing number of childless older people rely? (How) can the lack of children be compensated in the informal social network? What role does the state play and how is informal and formal support linked? Our comparative analyses of the support networks of childless elders are based on the ﬁrst two waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, including , people with (instrumental) activities of daily living limitations aged  and over from  European countries. On average,  per cent of older Europeans today have no children. Sporadic informal support for these elders is often taken over by the extended family, friends and neighbours, and thus the lack of children is compensated within the social network. Intense care tasks, however, are more likely provided by professional providers, especially in the case of childless older people. In countries with low social service provision, childless elders are therefore likely to experience a lack of (formal) support, especially when depending on vital care.},

The two countries have comparable family welfare systems but many historical, cultural and religious diﬀerences. Data for the respondents aged 75 or more years at the ﬁrst wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ({SHARE}) were analysed. Regressions were examined of three patterns of care from outside the household : informal support only, formal support only and both formal and informal care, with the predictor variables including whether informal help was provided by a family member living in the household. The results revealed that about one-half of the respondents received no help at all (France 51 \%, Israel 55 \%), about one-tenth received care from a household member (France 8 \%, Israel 10 \%), and one-third were helped by informal carers from outside the household (France 34 \%, Israel 33 \%). More French respondents (35 \%) received formal care services at home than Israelis (27 \%). Most predictors of the care patterns were similar in the two countries. The analysis showed that complementarity is a common outcome of the co-existence of formal and informal care, and that mixed provision occurs more frequently in situations of greater need. It is also shown that spouse care-givers had less formal home-care supports than either co-resident children or other family care-givers. Even so, spouses, children and other family care-givers all had considerable support from formal home-delivered care.},

Yet these classiﬁcations do not cover all care-related societal characteristics and limit our understanding of which speciﬁc societal characteristics are most important. Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (second wave, –), the effect of societal determinants relating to culture, welfare state context and socio-economic and demographic composition on informal and formal care use of older adults in  European countries was studied. Multinomial multi-level regression analyses showed that, in addition to individual determinants, societal determinants are salient for understanding care use. In countries with fewer home-based services, less residential care, more informal care support and women working full time, older adults are more likely to receive informal care only. Older adults are more likely to receive only formal home care or a combination of formal and informal care in countries with more extensive welfare state arrangements (i.e. more home-based services, higher pension generosity), whereas the odds of receiving a combination of informal and formal care are also larger in countries that specify a legal obligation to care for parents. We tentatively conclude that the incorporation of societal determinants rather than commonly used welfare state classiﬁcations results in more understanding of the societal conditions that determine older adults’ care use.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of informal care by adult children on the use of long-term care among the elderly in Europe and the effect of the level of the parent’s disability on this relationship. We focus on two types of formal home care that are the most likely to interact with informal care: paid domestic help and nursing care. Using recent European data emerging from the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ({SHARE}), we build a two-part utilization model analyzing both the decision to use each type of formal care or not and the amount of formal care received by the elderly. Instrumental variables estimations are used to control for the potential endogeneity existing between formal and informal care. We ﬁnd endogeneity of informal care in the decision to receive paid domestic help. Estimation results indicate that informal care substitutes for this type of formal home care. However, we ﬁnd that this substitution effect tends to disappear as the level of disability of the elderly person increases. Finally, informal care is a weak complement to nursing care, independently of the level of disability. These results highlight the heterogeneous effects of informal care on formal care use and suggest that informal care is an effective substitute for long-term care as long as the needs of the elderly are low and require unskilled type of care. Any policy encouraging informal care to decrease long-term care expenditures should take it into account to assess its effectiveness.},

The results of our multivariate analysis suggest that childless individuals do not generally fare worse than parents in terms of their economic, psychological, or social well-being. Although there is some indication for a ‘protective effect’ of marriage, having a partner does not per se contribute to greater psychological well-being: only those reporting satisfaction with the extent of reciprocity in their relationship report lower numbers of depression symptoms than their unmarried counterparts. We observe no systematic associations between parenthood (marriage, respectively) and individuals’ propensity to participate in social activities.

Previous research ﬁnds that they are disadvantaged on several network and support indicators. Yet, the role of different substitution mechanisms remains unclear. We examine two substitution mechanisms: substitution through adjustments of network size/composition and through higher efﬁciency of personal ties. Data are from the German Ageing Survey (childless: N = ,; parents without/with residentially proximate children: N = ,/,). Our descriptive and regression results on network size/composition and the number of potential informational and emotional supporters show that both mechanisms play a role: the childless have more friends and extended kin, and they are more likely to consider them as potential supporters, than parents. Across cohorts or age groups, the relative effect size of network size/composition versus tie efﬁciency changes. Parents with no children nearby constitute a mixed type that shows similarities to the childless on some indicators of social support and to parents with at least one child nearby on other indicators. Our ﬁndings provide a foundation for better predicting how current demographic trends affect future scenarios of social support in later life and for identifying the future need for formal care services. Thus, they are relevant for social scientists and policy makers alike.},

            In this essay. I suggest that the crisis in our understanding of fertility transitions is more apparent than real. Although most existing theories of fertility transition have been partially or wholly discredited, this reflects a tendency to assume that all fertility transitions share one or two causes, to ignore mortality decline as a precondition for fertility decline, to assume that pretransitional fertility is wholly governed by social constraints rather than by individual decision-making. and to test ideas on a decadal time scale. I end the essay by suggesting a perceptual. interactive approach to explaining fertility transitions that is closely allied to existing theories but focuses on conditions that lead couples to switch from postnatal to prenatal controls on family size.},

Such elements include the definition of concepts, the specification of a framework on the determinants of health status, the analysis of the mechanisms through which health change occurs in populations, the characterization of the attributes that allow us to identify different transition models, and the enumeration of the possible consequences of the transition. The propositions are presented with a sufficient level of generality as to make them applicable to different contexts; at the same time, an attempt is made to provide them with the necessary specificity to account for different national experiences, thus opening a space for future comparative research efforts. Through the systematization exercise presented in this article, we hope to contribute to the progress of a topic that has grown in importance during recent years. Such importance is due to the enormous potential that health transition theory has for understanding and transforming the growing complexity of our times.},

A secondary aim is to provide an analytical synthesi of the core determinants of fertility, grouping them within the analytical level in which they operate. Determinants are positioned at the individual and/or couple level (micro-level), social relationships and social networks (meso-level); and, by cultural and institutional settings (macro-level). The focus is both on the quantum and on the tempo of fertility, with a particular focus on the postponement o childbearing. The review incorporates both theoretical and empirical contributions with attention placed on empirically tested research and whether results support or falsify existing theoretical expectations. Attention is also devoted to causality and endogeneity issues. The paper concludes with an outline of the current challenges and opportunities for future research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} For the last 70 years the concept of the demographic transition has provided a basis for understanding and predicting population trends in the developing world. However, a majority of the developing world’s population will soon be post-transitional – what will happen then? This paper attempts to outline where answers to this question might be found. It suggests that a valuable way to organise the study of these issues is the concept of the demographic regime.
{OBJECTIVE} The aim of the paper is to encourage discussion on the nature of post-transitional demographic regimes around the world, especially in the developing world. The style of the reflection is that of a speculative essay – a Denkstűck or ballon d’essai. {SCOPE} In addition to a discussion of the concept of a demographic regime, the paper looks at three possible sources of information on the determinants of post-transitional regimes in the developing world: 1) the nature of the transition itself, 2) lessons drawn from pretransitional regimes, and 3) demographic trends in Europe and other developed countries, some which have been post-transitional for several decades.
{CONCLUSIONS} The paper concludes with a set of suggestions for future research on the topic.},

Further, we analyze the {PSID} men’s panel-updated fertility histories for their possible superiority over retrospective collection. One third to one half of men’s nonmarital births and births within previous marriages are missed in estimates from retrospective histories. Differential survey underrepresentation of previously married men compared with previously married women accounts for a substantial proportion of the deficits in previous-marriage fertility. More recent retrospective histories and panel-updated fertility histories improve reporting completeness, primarily by reducing the proportion of marital births from unions that are no longer intact at the survey date.},

The situation is particularly stark in the former Soviet Union, where male adult death rates are exceptionally high. In much of Asia, strong son preference has long informed unusually high female child mortality. And the impact of this on population sex ratios has been reinforced by the recent spread of sex-selective abortion. Especially in China, there is an unusually large number of boys relative to girls. Sex ratios are also skewed by migration, most notably male labor migration. Unbalanced sex ratios have many effects. Among other things, research has focused on the consequences of male outmigration for those who are left behind and on the implications of the coming heightened masculinity of young adult populations in Asia, e.g., with respect to marriage and crime.},

	abstract = {Rural regions in East Germany have been characterized by strong age- and sex-selective outmigration since 1990, which has resulted in unbalanced sex ratios in the age group 18e35 with pronounced surpluses of men. The East German countryside is unique in Europe in two respects: (1) the spatial and numerical extent of the overrepresentation of young men and (2) the missing equalization of sex ratio imbalances for groups in the age of forming a family. An analysis of statistical data shows that structural conditions, especially the situation on the labor market are important determinants of unbalanced sex ratios and sex-selective migration. However, in order to understand why rural East Germany stands out with an especially high surplus of young men, it is necessary to take the speciﬁc historical context e the legacy of the German Democratic Republic and the gendered and economic consequences of uniﬁcation into account, notably the continuously high work orientation of East German women in an economically difﬁcult environment.},

The argument is that urban areas offer skilled workers better labor markets. Assuming that there are more skilled males than females, this alone would predict a surplus of males. However, the presence of males with high incomes may attract not only skilled females but also unskilled females. Thus, a surplus of women in urban areas may result from a combination of better labor and marriage markets. Swedish municipality data support the results.},

Between 1989 and 2007, roughly 10 per cent of the East’s population at the time of reunification migrated from east to west. The emigrants were predominantly young and female. This selective migration pattern led to a tremendous deficit of females in the 18–29 year old age group in eastern Germany. Overall, the sex ratio in that age group is as low as 89 females per 100 males in the east. In some rural counties, the sex ratio is 80 females per 100 males. We find that excess female emigration at the county level is associated with gender disparities in educational attainment that favour women, a labour market structure that favours men and the lower availability of potential partners with similar levels of education in eastern Germany.},

Consequently, kinship structures likely display social stratification. However, the processes of kinship stratification are intricate, and its prevalence and antecedents are rarely studied empirically. We have estimated socioeconomic differences in kinship in Sweden using administrative register data of the total Swedish population. We created kinship networks for the 1973 birth cohort and followed the growth and decline of kin from birth to age 45 of this birth cohort. We analyzed consanguineous kin, as well as spouses, reproductive partners, parents-in-law, and siblings-in-law. We calculated the difference in total kinship size across earnings and educational groups. We broke down the contributions of specific kin groups to this difference and also analyzed which demographic behaviors and generations contributed most to socioeconomic differences in kinship. Among men and women with low socioeconomic status ({SES}), higher fertility in earlier generations resulted in more kin than those with high {SES}. Among low {SES} men and siblings, lower fertility and union instability narrowed {SES} differences in the number of kin.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Although male height is positively associated with many aspects of mate quality, average height men attain higher reproductive success in {US} populations. We hypothesize that this is because the advantages associated with taller stature accrue mainly from not being short, rather than from being taller than average. Lower fertility by short men may be a consequence of their and their partner’s lower scores on aspects of mate quality. Taller men, although they score higher on mate quality compared to average height men, may have lower fertility because they are more likely to be paired with taller women, who are potentially less fertile.
Methods: We analyzed data from The Integrated Health Interview Series ({IHIS}) of the United States (N 5 165,606). Segmented regression was used to examine patterns across the height continuum.
Results: On all aspects of own and partner quality, shorter men scored lower than both average height and taller men. Height more strongly predicted these aspects when moving from short to average height, than when moving from average to taller heights. Women of a given height who scored lower on mate quality also had shorter partners.
Conclusions: Shorter men faced a double disadvantage with respect to both their own mate quality and that of their spouses. Scores of taller men were only marginally higher than those of average height men, suggesting that being tall is less important than not being short. Although effect sizes were small, our results may partly explain why shorter and taller men have lower fertility than those of average stature. Am. J. Hum.

The study is based on retrospective event-history data from Austria, to which intensity (or hazard) regression is applied. The analysis suggests, first, that the birth of a child triggers housing-related and environment-related residential relocations. These are mostly moves within a labour-market area, but there are also migrations from cities to rural areas. Second, growing family size significantly reduces couples' wishes to and chances of moving over long distances for a job.

We use rich longitudinal register data from Finland and apply multilevel event history analysis to allow for multiple births and housing changes over the life course. We investigate the timing of fertility decisions and housing choices with respect to each other. We model childbearing and housing transitions jointly to control for timeinvariant unobserved characteristics of women, which may simultaneously influence their fertility behavior and housing choices, and we show how joint modeling leads to a deeper understanding of the interplay between the two domains of family life.},

	abstract = {Previous research has proposed four competing views on an individual’s fertility following a move from one social context to another. Each view has received support but has also been challenged in the literature. This study contributes to the existing discussion on fertility by providing an analysis of the effects of internal migration on the fertility of post-war Austrian and Polish female cohorts. The study is based on retrospective event-history data and applies intensity regression to both single and simultaneous equations. The analysis shows, ﬁrstly, that natives in urban areas in general and in large cities in particular have lower fertility compared with non-migrants in rural areas, both in Austria and Poland. Secondly, it reveals that people who move from one place to another adopt the fertility behaviour that dominates at the destination. Thirdly, we observe an elevated ﬁrst-birth risk for women who move because of union formation, and a short-term postponement of childbearing for those who settle in a large city. The country comparison shows some differences in fertility variation across settlements, but overall the results are quite similar, despite the different post-war societal contexts of the two countries.

	abstract = {Using data from Wave 1 of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia ({HILDA}) survey, this paper analyses the extent to which childlessness among Australian women aged 40–54 years varies according to the size and type of family in which they were brought up, and the level and type of schooling they had. Multilevel logistic analysis shows that having been educated in a non-government school, having stayed at school to year 12, having a small number of siblings, at age 14 having a father who was either dead or absent, at age 14 having a father who was employed in a professional occupation, or being a migrant from North or West Europe, North America, East Asia or South-East Asia, all are signiﬁcantly associated with higher rates of childlessness among women in the 40–54 years age range. The eﬀects of these early lifecourse variables on marital and socioeconomic status in later life, and hence on childlessness, are also considered. The implications of the ﬁndings for fertility trends and for Australia’s public debate are discussed.},

	abstract = {Behavioral and social scientists have identified many nonbiological predictors of mortality. An important limitation of much of this research, however, is that risk factors are not studied in comparison with one another or from across different fields of research. It therefore remains unclear which factors should be prioritized for interventions and policy to reduce mortality risk. In the current investigation, we compare 57 factors within a multidisciplinary framework. These include (i) adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial experiences during childhood and (ii) socioeconomic conditions, (iii) health behaviors, (iv) social connections, (v) psychological characteristics, and (vi) adverse experiences during adulthood. The current prospective cohort investigation with 13,611 adults from 52 to 104 y of age (mean age 69.3 y) from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study used weighted traditional (i.e., multivariate Cox regressions) and machine-learning (i.e., lasso, random forest analysis) statistical approaches to identify the leading predictors of mortality over 6 y of follow-up time. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-established behavioral risk factors of smoking, alcohol abuse, and lack of physical activity, economic (e.g., recent financial difficulties, unemployment history), social (e.g., childhood adversity, divorce history), and psychological (e.g., negative affectivity) factors were also among the strongest predictors of mortality among older American adults. The strength of these predictors should be used to guide future transdisciplinary investigations and intervention studies across the fields of epidemiology, psychology, sociology, economics, and medicine to understand how changes in these factors alter individual mortality risk.},

While some people are choosing to have smaller families, countries also report a ‘fertility gap’, which is the proportion of people who end up with fewer children than originally desired. This paper investigates some causes of the fertility gap in the {UK}. We amassed qualitative data from seven focus groups conducted among men and women of reproductive age with different educational backgrounds. These focus groups suggest that social support is an inﬂuential factor for Britons thinking about having children, although discussions differed in terms of whether this was support from partners or parents. Discussions with university-educated women featured themes of career opportunity costs, and non-university men contributed insights on the ﬁnancial burden of parenthood. This exploratory study provides up-to-date material on unwanted childlessness and the low fertility in the {UK}, and highlights the merit of using qualitative methods in understanding the fertility gap.},

The data are from 1,610 males aged 45–59 interviewed in 2001 for Wave 1 of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia ({HILDA}) survey, a large-scale, nationwide, longitudinal survey of the household population. Staged logistic regression models are used to identify the early lifecourse antecedents of a man being childless in later life and the mediating effects of work-related variables and duration of union. The results show that the father’s and mother’s occupations, the level and type of education, and birthplace are important early lifecourse antecedents of whether a man is childless in later life. The lengths of time a man has been in married and cohabiting and his current occupation are found shown to have significant relationships with whether he is childless.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of digitized text presents enormous opportunities for social scientists. Yet hand coding many blogs, speeches, government records, newspapers, or other sources of unstructured text is infeasible. Although computer scientists have methods for automated content analysis, most are optimized to classify individual documents, whereas social scientists instead want generalizations about the population of documents, such as the proportion in a given category. Unfortunately, even a method with a high percent of individual documents correctly classified can be hugely biased when estimating category proportions. By directly optimizing for this social science goal, we develop a method that gives approximately unbiased estimates of category proportions even when the optimal classifier performs poorly. We illustrate with diverse data sets, including the daily expressed opinions of thousands of people about the U.S. presidency. We also make available software that implements our methods and large corpora of text for further analysis.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, childlessness has increased across many European countries. In addition to socioeconomic characteristics, having a partner is considered a prerequisite in most fertility studies. Yet, still little is known about the partnership biographies of childless women and men. We assess the heterogeneity in the partnership trajectories of childless persons in Germany and explore compositional differences of partnership trajectories by gender and education. We use data from the German Family Panel to reconstruct partnership biographies reflecting the occurrence and frequency of different partnership states (singleness, living apart together, cohabitation, marriage). The sample comprises women and men born 1971–1973 whose life courses are observed from age 18–40. Applying sequence and cluster analysis, we identify five patterns of partnership trajectories: (1) ‘Marriage’ (14.6\%); (2) ‘Longterm cohabitation’ (11.8\%) with one partner; (3) ‘Serial cohabitation’ (15.6\%); (4) ‘{LAT}’ (18.8\%), long-term/multiple living-apart-together relationships; and (5) ‘Single’ (39.3\%), long-term singleness. Men are overrepresented in the ‘Single’ cluster, especially if highly educated. Women are more often married and more likely to experience long-lasting singleness or multiple {LAT} episodes when being highly educated. We speculate that theories predicting high levels of childlessness in contexts where gender norms and work-family policies do not account for the increasing gender equality in education and labor force participation might also explain differences in the pathways leading to childlessness. Generally, our findings point at a more elaborate conceptualization of childlessness that moves away from a binary cross-sectional indicator and set the ground for future cross-national comparisons.},

	abstract = {Over 50\% of white women now in the midst of the childbearing years have never borne a child. These levels of childlessness for women in their 20s are the highest ones in a time series that spans most of the twentieth century. Will postponed parenthood be translated into very high levels of permanent childlessness? Or will these cohorts ‘catch-up’ with a late fertility flurry in their 30s and 4Os? We examine three projection strategies: one using women’s stated fertility expectations, a second relying on the patterns of previous cohorts, and a third which posits that current rates will persist into the future. The predictive validity of these different projection strategies are tested with data for the 1980-87 period. We show that the projection based on current period rates performs well. Further, we argue that it better captures the first birth process than other models. We forecast levels of 20\% childless for cohorts of white women born in the early 1960s. Recent trends for nonwhites are very different than those for whites; levels of 4\% are forecast for nonwhite women.},

	abstract = {Sociological theory views modernization as a macroprocess of transition from traditional society to the society of modernity. More specifically, the main sociological theories of modernization are based on the ideas of evolutionism, functionalism, and diffusionism. Attention is also paid to the theoretical conceptualization of modernization processes in non-Western societies, which can be explained by the interaction of endogenous and exogenous factors. Within the framework of scientific discourse and the public consciousness, theory of modernization is sometimes questioned as a view of a progressive development of the world. Today, the global spread of modernization is more adequately theorized in terms of historical and sociocultural dynamic shifts from institutionalized, vertically integrated forms of social solidarity to network forms and social movements. This view of modernization as a communication phenomenon that involves the changing ways of interaction and media use highlights its self-reflexive nature, showing how modernization can only gain an access to itself by a series of partial and conflicting descriptions.},

It organizes people into families and determines the characteristics of parents. In this article, I review the literature on the causes and consequences of trends and variation in assortative mating. Explanations for why assortative mating varies have been dominated by modernization theory, but perspectives emphasizing economic inequality and gender inequality have gained momentum in recent years. Underexplored is how changes in the structure of search have affected mate selection. The idea that assortative mating affects inequality and population composition is one of the primary motivations for its study but, until recently, has rarely been tested empirically. I review the literature on the consequences of assortative mating for (a) inequality within generations, (b) inequality between generations, (c) long-run population change, and (d ) relationship quality and dissolution. I conclude with suggestions for future research.},

As baccalaureate degree fields are related to occupation, an important question remains about whether field-of-study homogamy begets occupational homogamy. We drew on the school-to-work transition literature, which shows that baccalaureate degree fields differ in their linkages to a targeted or diffuse set of occupational destinations. We analyzed 34,373 college-educated newlyweds from the 2009–2019 American Community Surveys. Log-linear analysis revealed a tendency for college graduates, especially those in vocational specific fields (fields that have targeted connections to specific occupations; e.g., law, health, and education), to marry a spouse in the same field. In addition, occupational homogamy was more likely to occur among couples with two spouses in the same vocational specific field than among couples with two spouses in different fields. By examining patterns and implications of field-of-study assortative mating, this study underlines the importance of horizontal stratification of higher education in shaping meeting opportunities and highlights how pathways from field of study to occupation structure marriage markets.},

	abstract = {Method: Retrospective partnership histories on 138,739 women and men from the Generations and Gender Survey and Harmonized Histories datafiles were used. Monthly data on entry into cohabitation or marriage as the first coresidential union, and on entry into marriage were analyzed using life table and event history techniques. The overall incidences of parental separation and of premarital cohabitation were used as contextual-level measures in the event history analyses.
Results: The association between parental separation and partnership formation was moderated by the spread of premarital cohabitation. Higher incidence of cohabitation was associated with a weaker positive association between parental separation and cohabitation, and a more negative association between parental separation and marriage. The associations between parental separation and partnership formation were not weaker when parental separation was more common.
Conclusion: Children of divorce have been among the forerunners of the increase in cohabitation and the retreat from marriage.},

This review focuses on the relations of parental age to intelligence, health outcomes, longevity and other characteristics of offspring. Many researchers have demonstrated that children of older parents tend to be more intelligent than do children of younger parents, although there are also some negative ﬁndings. Either teenage or advanced parental age is associated with risk of birth and health outcomes in offspring. Parental age at birth displays a negative association with offspring longevity. Parental age can also inﬂuence dominant characters, sex ratio, personality and development process of the offspring. To fully analyze the inﬂuence of parental age on the offspring is of great signiﬁcance in deciding the optimal age for parenthood.},

	abstract = {During the past decades, childless old age has attracted a considerable amount of scholarly interest. However, few studies address this phenomenon in Southern European familistic welfare states, where there is a pervading expectation that family members, especially spouses and children, care for their older relatives. The present cross-sectional study aims to analyse the relationship between childlessness, social networks and wellbeing in a sample of 612 Portuguese individuals aged 65 and over, comprising two sub-samples: parents (N = 540) and childless (N = 72). Data were collected through a research protocol that included a sociodemographic questionnaire, a personal social network assessment inventory, and several validated psychometric measures of psychological wellbeing focusing on mental health, loneliness, depression and satisfaction with life. Childless older adults’ social networks are smaller but more diverse, including a more significant proportion of friends and neighbours. No differences were found in perceived support from significant others, but network reciprocity was lower among non-parents. The childless subsample also reported more feelings of loneliness and less life satisfaction, but regression analysis showed that parenthood status, per se, is not significantly related to any outcome measures. Besides the central role of sociodemographic characteristics and personal functioning measures in explaining psychological wellbeing variance, several network factors were also identified as influential predictors. Implications for micro-level network intervention and macro-level social policy making are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: The {ELSA} 85 project is a population-based study with the purpose to learn more about the “elderly elderly”. The aim of this part of the {ELSA} 85 study is to explore the effects of childlessness on the psychological wellbeing, living situation and social support of 85-year old individuals.
Methods: A postal questionnaire was sent to all (650) 85-year old men and women living in Linköping Municipality in 2007. Psychological well-being and social network was measured using a number of questions.
Results: 496 individuals participated in the study. No differences in psychological wellbeing were found between the 85-year olds who were childless and those who were parents. The childless 85-year olds were less likely to have relatives close by and to receive help than those who were parents. Individuals of both groups were equally likely to end up in institutional care, to have friends close by and to be in contact with neighbours.
Conclusions: Even though elderly childless individuals have social networks of less support potential than those who are parents there are no differences in certain psychological wellbeing indicators between the two groups. Apparently, childless elderly individuals find ways to cope with whatever negative effects of childlessness they may have experienced.},

Significant differences were found in the level of family integration with black childless being in more contact with and in receipt of more supports from relatives. They were also more likely than whites to have a family member available as a caregiver. To interpret these findings, we suggest that the families of black childless place more emphasis on a collateral form of organization that capitalizes upon the sibling bond as a link to nieces and nephews. In contrast, white families emphasize vertical ties between generations which potentially can exclude the childless.},

Data were derived from a sample of 2,858 elders (aged 65 years and older) from the Vivre/Leben/ Vivere study, a large survey addressing family life and health conditions of older people in Switzerland. Conflict density in family networks and the betweenness centrality of respondents in family conflict are significantly associated with health-related quality of life measures. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that conflict–health associations are mediated by the level of perceived individual stress where psychological health is concerned. Family conflict structures depend to a large extent on family composition and age. This study stresses the importance of older adults actively shaping the composition of their family contexts in ways that promote both conflict and stress avoidance.},

	abstract = {The social networks of older people are a significant influence on their health and wellbeing. Adult children are an important element in their parent’s network and provide the majority of informal care. The morphology of personal networks alters with age, employment, gender and relationships. Not having children automatically reduces both vertical familial structure and affects the wider formal and informal social links that children can bring. Childless men are missing from gerontological, reproduction, sociological and psychological research. These fields have all mainly focused on family and women. This paper reports on an auto/biographical qualitative study framed by biographical, feminist, gerontological and lifecourse approaches. Data were gathered from semi-structured biographical interviews with 14 self-defined involuntarily childless men aged between 49 and 82 years old. A latent thematic analysis highlighted the complex intersections between childlessness and individual agency, relationships and socio-cultural structures. The impact of major lifecourse events and non-events had significant implications for how childless people perform and view their social and self-identity. I argue that involuntary childlessness affects the social, emotional and relational aspects of men’s lived experience across the lifecourse.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Adult children are a primary focus of family and caregiver research. In contrast, relatively little is known about childless elders with a disability, including their care needs and the state of their overall well-being compared to elderly parents. We addressed this gap by examining the relationship between childlessness and the care and well-being of adults aged 75 and older with a disability.
Methods: Parents and childless persons aged 75 and older were compared using data from the 1998 to 2004 waves of the Health and Retirement Study ({HRS}). We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between childlessness and care provision (personal care and assistive devise use) and ordinal regression to examine the relationships of parental status, personal care, and use of assistive devices with well-being. The analysis was based on 2048 observations from 1456 community-dwelling respondents who had difficulty walking across a room or getting into or out of bed.
Results: Compared to parents, childless elders with a disability generally do not receive less care or have worse psychological well-being. However, being unmarried reduces the likelihood of having personal care and is associated with depressive affect. Use of assistive devices is associated with less depressive affect.
Conclusion: Childless older adults are similar to parents on measures of psychological well-being and care provision. This finding has important implications, as it is projected that 30\% of baby boomers who will need assistance will lack care from spouses or adult children. Further exploration of compensatory resources is suggested.},

	abstract = {Using data from the ﬁrst wave of the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study conducted in 2002–03, this paper examines the economic, psychological and social wellbeing among 1,467 men aged 40–59 years with diﬀerent parenthood histories and circumstances : the childless, fathers who live with their children, non-co-resident fathers, and ‘empty-nest fathers ’. The gerontological interest is whether there are variations in wellbeing by parenting, and whether they persist in old age. The results showed that fathers have higher incomes than childless men, regardless of their partner history. As regards psychological wellbeing, men’s partner history counts, not their parenthood status. Being single contributes to low levels of psychological wellbeing. The ﬁndings provide evidence of the socially integrating eﬀects of parenthood and for men’s ‘good-provider ’ role. Childless men and nonco-resident fathers report poorer quality family relationships. In addition, childless men were least likely to report helping others in the community. Overall, more support is found for the notion that fatherhood is a transforming event than that the wellbeing beneﬁts derive from fathering activities. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the ﬁndings for inequalities in wellbeing and informal support among the male members of the cohort born during 1943–63 when they reach old age.},

	abstract = {After the spouse, children are the most likely source of informal support for an older person when the frailties of advanced old age create the need for help. Childlessness may thus be seen as particularly a problem for older people. In general, to compensate for the lack of children, childless people develop closer relationships with available next-of-kin and non-kin. Despite this, in times of need they are likely to ﬁnd themselves with inadequate informal support. Using data from the Bangor Longitudinal Study of Ageing, this article explores the consequences of childlessness among persons aged 85 years or more living in rural Wales. The results indicate that by the time they reach old age, childless people have adapted to their situation and developed expectations consistent with being childfree. They have closer relationships with collateral kin, friendships are important and a high value is placed on independence. Nevertheless, unless they die suddenly or after a short acute illness, almost all of them enter residential care or a long-stay hospital at the end of their lives. It is also shown that the situation of childless people varies greatly and depends on several factors, particularly marital status, gender, social and ﬁnancial capital, and on the person’s earlier investment in the strengthening of next-of-kin and non-kin networks.},

Because the absolute number of the frail elderly is set to increase, notwithstanding the increase in life expectancy in good health, a top-heavy intergenerational chain is likely both to put stress on the middle generation, and result in the older and younger generations competing for their support. Thus, issues of the redistribution of financial and time resources become relevant in the middle and younger generations when frailty emerges in the older generation. This article adopts a bi-generational perspective in order to examine not only whether social inequality affects resources available to the dependent elderly, but also whether and how a frail elderly person’s demands impact differently on children’s resources and life chances across gender and social classes, as well as what the impact of specific patterns of public care provision (other than healthcare) is on these inequalities.},

The relationship between childlessness and psychological wellbeing varies by the wellbeing measures employed, life stage and societal context.

This paper examines the relationship between lifetime childlessness, depressive mood and quality of life in early old age using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe ({SHARE}) (N = 21,295). Region-speciﬁc Ordinary Least Squares Analysis is performed to investigate this relationship and the mediating roles of health selection and marital status are explored. No main effect of childlessness is observed in any of the regions net of socio-demographic, economic and health factors. The signiﬁcant role of health selection in this relationship is only evident in Eastern Europe. The ﬁndings of this study support a more in-depth analysis of the role of marital status in mediating the relationship between childlessness and psychological wellbeing. Consistent relationships between marital status and both measures of wellbeing support further analysis of marital selection in this regard.},

Lifelong childlessness results in smaller networks among men and women in Amsterdam and Berlin, and in the Dutch sample it leads to higher income levels. Dutch men who have never had children and Dutch women who have outlived their children have relatively low life satisfaction levels. In Germany, marital history is a more powerful predictor of life satisfaction in old age than parental history. The findings attest to the importance of distinguishing lifelong childlessness from outliving one's children and of considering the consequences of childlessness for a variety of life domains.},

This article is based on a qualitative analysis of interviews from a research project on strategies used by the seniors to maintain their personal autonomy, the results of which demonstrated that the informal and particularly the family networks of childless elderly people are not always any less wide or dense than those of other senior citizens. An evident precondition for childless seniors to be able to negotiate old-age support is that they have actively and over the long term cultivated a network in their previous life stages. Nevertheless, it was found that childless seniors display a sense of having superficial and uncertain roots in their wider families, and this suggests a possible difference in how they define their entitlement to more extensive and intensive help from relatives. The author suggests that a normative relationship between the kinds and scope of support offered on the one hand and particular types of kinship on the other may pressure childless seniors to revise their expectations of significant others and their loose obligation to provide assistance, and conversely these seniors may accentuate their own responsibility and the importance of personal autonomy.},

	abstract = {Changes in population and family structures are altering the provision of care for dependent older people. In Southern European countries like Spain, such care is still largely provided by family, typically spouses and adult daughters. However, an increasing proportion of women have entered the labour force, thereby affecting their availability. To study the demand and supply balance of informal care and to quantify the need for formal care when there is a deficit, we have developed a mixed microsimulation–agent-based model ({ABM}). Based on nuptiality, fertility and mortality levels of cohorts born at ten-year intervals between 1908 and 1968, the model starts with a microsimulation of the lifecycle of individuals and their close relatives until death. The {ABM} then determines the amount of time available or needed to care for family members, starting from age 50. Estimates are derived from Spanish survey data on employment, disability and time of care received. Surprisingly, results show that the family care deficit was greater in the older cohorts due to higher mortality and thus a greater impact of widowhood. However, for future elderly persons, we foresee that persistent below-replacement fertility and, paradoxically, the prolongation of the lifespan of couples will increase the demand for formal care as there will be more couples with both members incapacitated but without children to take care of them.},

Explicit attention was paid to diversity among the childless and to their biographical pasts. The pattern of results was similar for both countries. Those who never had children had smaller networks in old age than parents, a finding partially attributable to a more limited supply of kin. There was no evidence for a competing hypothesis, namely, that childlessness is a means for greater sociability. Contrary to expectations, those who had outlived their children were not more socially isolated than those who had never had children. Neither was there support for the expectation that parenthood-history differences would be greater among women than men. Last, the findings showed that parenthood contributes to social integration independently of marriage and employment.},

I dissect the emergence of these wage disparities between women, using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1992–2015). Compositional change with respect to education is the main driver for growing inequality. Other factors are less influential but still relevant: marginal returns for several wage-related personal characteristics have grown faster in male-typed occupations. Net of individual-level heterogeneity, traditionally male occupations have also become more attractive because of rising returns to taskspecific skills. Discrimination of women in typically male lines of work seems to have declined, too, which erased part of the wage penalty these women had previously experienced. In sum, I document changes in the occupational sorting behavior of women as well as shifts in occupation-level reward mechanisms that have had a profound impact on the state of inequality between working women.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Information on cohort fertility is critical for the understanding of population dynamics, but only in historical settings can it be calculated without forecasting. Several forecasting methods exist, but their strengths and weaknesses have not been evaluated. Relying on the Human Fertility Database, the largest high-quality fertility dataset to date, and the globally representative United Nations World Population Prospects, we present an assessment of all major methods that complete cohort fertility. This analysis is crucial to advance the understanding of benefits and drawbacks of state-of-the-art methods. We analyze forecast accuracy and uncertainty quantification, identify methodological breakthroughs, and uncover unresolved issues. This study constitutes an evaluation benchmark for cohort fertility forecasting and may inspire establishment of similar evaluation benchmarks in related fields.
          , 
            Forecasts of completed fertility predict how many children will be born on average by women over their entire reproductive lifetime. These forecasts are important in informing public policy and influencing additional research in the social sciences. However, nothing is known about how to choose a forecasting method from a large basket of variants. We identified 20 major methods, with 162 variants altogether. The approaches range from naive freezing of current age-specific fertility rates to methods that use statistically sophisticated techniques or are grounded in demographic theory. We assess each method by evaluating the overall accuracy and if provided, uncertainty estimates using fertility data of all available birth cohorts and countries of the Human Fertility Database, which covers 1,096 birth cohorts from 29 countries. Across multiple measures of forecast accuracy, we find only four methods that consistently outperform the naive freeze rates method, and only two methods produce uncertainty estimates that are not severely downward biased. Among the top four, there are two simple extrapolation methods and two Bayesian methods. The latter are demanding in terms of input data, statistical techniques, and computational power but do not consistently complete cohort fertility more accurately at all truncation ages than simple extrapolation. This broad picture is unchanged if we base the validation on 201 United Nations countries and six world regions, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, northern America, and Oceania.},

Our indices are produced by applying indirect standardization to register data. They enable us to decompose the overall fertility trends, as measured by the period {TFR}, into its birth-order speciﬁc components. Swedish fertility has shown strong ﬂuctuations during our study period and these ﬂuctuations have been particularly dramatic during recent years. A postponement of the age at ﬁrst birth and a sudden shift to shorter birth intervals are important components in the fertility trends. A peak in the level of childbearing at the beginning of the present decade has now been followed by a sharp drop in the propensity to give birth. This change in behaviour pertains to women of all parities.},

	abstract = {As with many social transf­er schemes, pens­ ion sys­tems around the world are often prog­ res­sive: indi­vid­u­als with lower incomes receive a higher per­cent­age of their income as a subs­e­quent pens­ion. On the other hand, those with lower earni­ngs have higher mor­tali­ty and thus accu­mu­late fewer years of pen­sion income. Both of these oppos­ing fac­tors influ­ence the pro­gres­sive­ness of pen­sion sys­tems. Empirical efforts to dise­ n­tang­ le the effects of mort­al­ity inequali­ty on lifet­ime pens­ion inequali­ty have been scarce. Using Swedi­sh taxa­ ­tion data linked with death regi­s­ters for 1970–2018, we study how educ­ at­ion and prer­ e­tire­ment earni­ngs relate to lifet­ime pens­ ions from age 60 onward and how mort­al­ity inequalities cont­rib­ute to overa­ ll inequalities in lifet­ime pens­ ions. The results show that a prog­ res­sive replacem­ ent struct­ure and mort­al­ity dif­ fer­ences con­trib­ute to the over­all dis­tri­bu­tion of pen­sion pay­ments over the life course. Up to one quart­er of lifet­ime pens­ ion inequali­ty is attribu­ t­a­ ble to the greater long­ ev­ity of socially advant­aged groups—part­icu­ ­larly among men. Hence, mort­ali­ty inequalities are an import­ant determ­ i­nant of the overa­ ll degree of between-group income transf­ers in a pens­ ion syst­em, but they are not as import­ant as inequalities in prior earni­ngs.},

	abstract = {Low fertility and childlessness have been largely interpreted as being driven by the same mechanisms, although they may be qualitatively different phenomena. The present article discusses this assumption and studies determinants of childlessness by comparing them with determinants of low fertility. Drawing on micro-level data from the European Labour Force Survey (2005–2010) and macro-level data from external data sources, it enters the debate on the micro- and macro-determinants of fertility and childlessness by analysing women who live with or without children when they are 35–39 years old. By means of a series of multilevel models, it discusses the moderating role of the institutional and normative context in the link between individual characteristics and childlessness, and it analyses the extent to which micro- and macro-level determinants of childlessness differ from factors associated with low-fertility. The results indicate that the macro-level factors associated with individual childlessness are similar to those identified in the literature on low fertility. However, interesting differences emerge in how reconciliation and family support policies relate on childlessness and low-fertility across different groups of women. Overall, these findings highlight the importance to study childlessness as a phenomenon on its own, distinguishing its determinants from determinants of (low) fertility.},

Partnership, education, and employment histories are examined using sequence analysis with dynamic Hamming distance and cluster analysis. Discrepancy analysis indicates a country-effect in women’s biographies although life-course patterns identified in each country share similarities. Overall, seven lifecourse trajectories have been identified, with the most numerous cluster comprising single, working women who completed their education at a relatively young age. The results highlight a marked variation in the life-courses of childless women.

A model of time allocation illustrates how the specialization of spouses in home or market production responds to preferences, comparative advantages and public policies. We draw lessons from existing evidence on the impacts of family policies on women's careers and children's wellbeing. There is to date little or no evidence of beneficial effects of longer parental leave (or fathers' quotas) on maternal participation and earnings. In most cases longer leave delays mothers' return to work, without long-lasting consequences on their careers. More generous childcare funding instead encourages female participation whenever subsidized childcare replaces maternal childcare. Impacts on child development depend on counterfactual childcare arrangements and tend to be more beneficial for disadvantaged households. In-work benefits targeted to low-earners have clear positive impacts on lone mothers' employment and negligible impacts on other groups. While most of this literature takes policy as exogenous, political economy aspects of policy adoption help understand the interplay between societal changes, family policies and gender equality.},

Under certain conditions, the controlled direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations—an important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation strategy from the biostatistics literature. We extend this approach by deriving a consistent variance estimator and demonstrating how to conduct a sensitivity analysis.

Relatedly, researchers advocating for new methods typically compare their method to at best 2 or 3 other causal inference strategies and test using simulations that may or may not be designed to equally tease out ﬂaws in all the competing methods. The causal inference data analysis challenge, “Is Your {SATT} Where It’s At?”, launched as part of the 2016 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference, sought to make progress with respect to both of these issues. The researchers creating the data testing grounds were distinct from the researchers submitting methods whose efﬁcacy would be evaluated. Results from 30 competitors across the two versions of the competition (black-box algorithms and do-it-yourself analyses) are presented along with post-hoc analyses that reveal information about the characteristics of causal inference strategies and settings that affect performance. The most consistent conclusion was that methods that ﬂexibly model the response surface perform better overall than methods that fail to do so. Finally new methods are proposed that combine features of several of the top-performing submitted methods.},

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.},

In this article, we show that if police racially discriminate when choosing whom to investigate, analyses using administrative records to estimate racial discrimination in police behavior are statistically biased, and many quantities of interest are unidentified—even among investigated individuals—absent strong and untestable assumptions. Using principal stratification in a causal mediation framework, we derive the exact form of the statistical bias that results from traditional estimation. We develop a bias-correction procedure and nonparametric sharp bounds for race effects, replicate published findings, and show the traditional estimator can severely underestimate levels of racially biased policing or mask discrimination entirely. We conclude by outlining a general and feasible design for future studies that is robust to this inferential snare.},

This estimator has attractive theoretical properties and only requires practitioners to do two things they are already comfortable with: (1) specify a binary regression model for the propensity score, and (2) specify a regression model for the outcome variable. Perhaps the most interesting property of this estimator is its so-called “double robustness.” Put simply, the estimator remains consistent for the {ATE} if either the propensity score model or the outcome regression is misspecified but the other is properly specified. After explaining the {AIPW} estimator, we conduct a Monte Carlo experiment that compares the finite sample performance of the {AIPW} estimator to three common competitors: a regression estimator, an inverse propensity weighted ({IPW}) estimator, and a propensity score matching estimator. The Monte Carlo results show that the {AIPW} estimator has comparable or lower mean square error than the competing estimators when the propensity score and outcome models are both properly specified and, when one of the models is misspecified, the {AIPW} estimator is superior.},

We explicate several methodological misunderstandings widespread across disciplines by revisiting the controversy concerning the validity of {RD} design when applied to close elections. Although many researchers invoke the local or as-if-random assumption near the threshold, it is more stringent than the required continuity assumption. We show that this seemingly subtle point determines the appropriateness of various statistical methods and changes our understanding of how sorting invalidates the design. When multiple-testing problems are also addressed, we ﬁnd that evidence for sorting in {US} House elections is substantially weaker and highly dependent on estimation methods. Finally, we caution that despite the temptation to improve the external validity, the extrapolation of {RD} estimates away from the threshold sacriﬁces the design’s advantage in internal validity.},

By contrast, we show that controlling for commonly available postoutcome (i.e., future) values of the treatment variable can help detect, reduce, and even remove omitted variable bias (unobserved confounding). The premise is that the same unobserved confounder that affects treatment also affects the future value of the treatment. Future treatments thus proxy for the unmeasured confounder, and researchers can exploit these proxy measures productively. We establish several new results: Regarding a commonly assumed data-generating process involving future treatments, we (1) introduce a simple new approach and show that it strictly reduces bias, (2) elaborate on existing approaches and show that they can increase bias, (3) assess the relative merits of alternative approaches, and (4) analyze true state dependence and selection as key challenges. (5) Importantly, we also introduce a new nonparametric test that uses future treatments to detect hidden bias even when future-treatment estimation fails to reduce bias. We illustrate these results empirically with an analysis of the effect of parental income on children’s educational attainment.},

Since the 1970s, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in ﬁelds such as economics, epidemiology, medicine and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods—or developing methods related to matching—do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research.

	abstract = {China launched an unprecedented program to control its population in 1971. Experts have dismissed the official estimate of 400 million births averted by this program as greatly exaggerated yet neglect to provide their own estimates. Counterfactual projections based on fertility declines in other countries suggest that China’s program-averted population numbered 360–520 million as of 2015. The low end of this range is based on Vietnam—China’s best national comparator, with a two-child program of its own—and the high end is based on a 16-country comparator selected, ironically, by critics of the official estimate. The latter comparator further implies that China’s one-child program itself averted a population of 400 million by 2015, three-quarters of the total averted population. All such estimates are projected to double by 2060, due mostly to counterfactual population momentum. These and other findings presented herein affirm the astonishing impact of China’s draconian policy choices and challenge the current consensus that rapid socioeconomic progress drove China’s fertility well below two children per family. International comparisons of fertility and income suggest instead that China’s very low fertility arrived two or three decades too soon. If China had not harshly enforced a norm of 1.5-children during the last quarter century, most mothers would have had two children, one-half birth higher than observed.},

	abstract = {China launched an unprecedented program to control its population in 1971. Experts have dismissed the official estimate of 400 million births averted by this program as greatly exaggerated yet neglect to provide their own estimates. Counterfactual projections based on fertility declines in other countries suggest that China’s program-averted population numbered 360–520 million as of 2015. The low end of this range is based on Vietnam—China’s best national comparator, with a two-child program of its own—and the high end is based on a 16-country comparator selected, ironically, by critics of the official estimate. The latter comparator further implies that China’s one-child program itself averted a population of 400 million by 2015, three-quarters of the total averted population. All such estimates are projected to double by 2060, due mostly to counterfactual population momentum. These and other findings presented herein affirm the astonishing impact of China’s draconian policy choices and challenge the current consensus that rapid socioeconomic progress drove China’s fertility well below two children per family. International comparisons of fertility and income suggest instead that China’s very low fertility arrived two or three decades too soon. If China had not harshly enforced a norm of 1.5-children during the last quarter century, most mothers would have had two children, one-half birth higher than observed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In spite of long-held beliefs that traits related to reproductive success tend to become fixed by evolution with little or no genetic variation, there is now considerable evidence that the natural variation of fertility within populations is genetically influenced and that a portion of that influence is related to the motivational precursors to fertility. We conduct a two-stage analysis to examine these inferences in a time-ordered multivariate context. First, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979, and {LISREL} analysis, we develop a structural equation model in which five hypothesized motivational precursors to fertility, measured in 1979–1982, predict both a child-timing and a child-number outcome, measured in 2002. Second, having chosen two time-ordered sequences of six variables from the {SEM} to represent our phenotypic models, we use Mx to conduct both univariate and multivariate behavioral genetic analyses with the selected variables. Our results indicate that one or more genes acting within a gene network have additive effects that operate through child-number desires to affect both the timing of the next child born and the final number of children born, that one or more genes acting through a separate network may have additive effects operating through gender role attitudes to produce downstream effects on the two fertility outcomes, and that no genetic variance is associated with either child-timing intentions or educational intentions.},

The aim of this paper is to first reflect on reasons for this lack of integration, provide a review of previous examinations, take stock of what we have learned until now and propose future research frontiers. We review the early foundations of proximate determinants followed by behavioural genetic (family and twin) studies that isolated the extent of genetic influence on fertility traits. We then discuss research that considers gene and environment interaction and the importance of cohort and country-specific estimates, followed by multivariate models that explore motivational precursors to fertility and education. The next section on molecular genetics reviews fertility-related candidate gene studies and their shortcomings and on-going work on genome wide association studies. Work in evolutionary anthropology and biology is then briefly examined, focusing on evidence for natural selection. Biological and genetic factors are relevant in explaining and predicting fertility traits, with socio-environmental factors and their interaction still key in understanding outcomes. Studying the interplay between genes and the environment, new data sources and integration of new methods will be central to understanding and predicting future fertility trends.},

When comparing earlier and more recent transition experiences, important similarities and disparities can be seen. Everywhere mortality decline appears to have played a central role for fertility decline. The differences in the timing of the response of fertility to mortality decline, with very small gaps historically and prolonged ones in more recent transitions, plus the much more rapid decline in vital rates in many developing countries, constitute an important challenge to any general explanation of the process. The speciﬁc characteristics of recent transitions have led to decades of higher population growth rates, and promise to give way to much more rapid dynamics of population ageing in many countries. This may limit the ability of newcomers to take full advantage of the demographic transition for the social and economic modernisation of their societies. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The United Nations ({UN}) recently released population projections based on data until 2012 and a Bayesian probabilistic methodology. Analysis of these data reveals that, contrary to previous literature, the world population is unlikely to stop growing this century. There is an 80\% probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional {UN} high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations.

              The United Nations released new population projections for all countries in July 2014. Gerland
              et al.
              analyzed the data and describe the probabilistic population projections for the entire world as well as individual regions and countries (see the Perspective by Smeeding). World population is likely to continue growing for the rest of the century, with at least a 3.5-fold increase in the population of Africa. Furthermore, the ratio of working-age people to older people is almost certain to decline substantially in all countries, not just currently developed ones.

	abstract = {Approaches and developments in demographic and population forecasting since 1980 are reviewed. Three approaches to forecasting demographic processes are extrapolation, expectation (individual-level birth expectations or population-level opinions of experts), and theory-based structural modelling involving exogenous variables. Models include 0–3 factors (age, period and cohort). Decomposition and disaggregation are also used in multistate models, including macrosimulation and microsimulation. Forecasting demographic change is difficult; accuracy depends on the particular situation or trends, but it is not clear when a method will perform best. Estimates of uncertainty (model-based ex ante error, expert-opinion-based ex ante error, and ex post error) differ; uncertainty estimation is highly uncertain. Probabilistic population forecasts are based on stochastic population renewal or random scenarios. The approaches to population forecasting, demographic process forecasting and error estimation are closely linked. Complementary methods that combine approaches are increasingly employed. The paper summarises developments, assesses progress and considers the future.},

The present paper is concerned with this struggle, mostly restricted to the case of fertility. The central question investigated here is: given observed period data, what can we conclude about the completed family size of real women? I review several existing methods to infer cohort fertility from period fertility measures. The conclusion is that, for each method, its justifiability can be verified only empirically: by looking at cohort fertility directly. To illustrate how this can be done, the paper analyses fertility data from a cohort perspective for two countries, Italy and the Netherlands.},

This article looks at the last 50 years of demographic change, one of the most extraordinary periods in demographic history. During this period, world population grew at rates that have never been seen before and will almost surely never be seen again. There were many concerns about the potential impact of rapid population growth in the 1960s, including mass starvation in countries such as India, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and increased poverty in low-income countries. The actual experience was very different. World food production increased faster than world population in every decade since the 1960s, resource prices fell during most of the period, and poverty declined significantly in much of the developing world. The article considers the economic and demographic explanations for the surprising successes of this important period in demographic history. It also looks at regions that have been less successful, especially Africa, and at the lessons for dealing with the important challenges that still remain.},

The health and economic implications of mortality reduction have been given substantial attention, but the observed malleability of human mortality has not been placed in a broad evolutionary context. We quantify the rate and amount of mortality reduction by comparing a variety of human populations to the evolved human mortality profile, here estimated as the average mortality pattern for ethnographically observed hunter-gatherers. We show that human mortality has decreased so substantially that the difference between hunter-gatherers and today’s lowest mortality populations is greater than the difference between hunter-gatherers and wild chimpanzees. The bulk of this mortality reduction has occurred since 1900 and has been experienced by only about 4 of the roughly 8,000 human generations that have ever lived. Moreover, mortality improvement in humans is on par with or greater than the reductions in mortality in other species achieved by laboratory selection experiments and endocrine pathway mutations. This observed plasticity in age-specific risk of death is at odds with conventional theories of aging.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} For the last 70 years the concept of the demographic transition has provided a basis for understanding and predicting population trends in the developing world. However, a majority of the developing world’s population will soon be post-transitional – what will happen then? This paper attempts to outline where answers to this question might be found. It suggests that a valuable way to organise the study of these issues is the concept of the demographic regime.
{OBJECTIVE} The aim of the paper is to encourage discussion on the nature of post-transitional demographic regimes around the world, especially in the developing world. The style of the reflection is that of a speculative essay – a Denkstűck or ballon d’essai. {SCOPE} In addition to a discussion of the concept of a demographic regime, the paper looks at three possible sources of information on the determinants of post-transitional regimes in the developing world: 1) the nature of the transition itself, 2) lessons drawn from pretransitional regimes, and 3) demographic trends in Europe and other developed countries, some which have been post-transitional for several decades.
{CONCLUSIONS} The paper concludes with a set of suggestions for future research on the topic.},

These effects are driven by low-edu­cated indi­vid­u­als, mar­ried men, and full-time worke­ rs and reflect changes in the likel­i­hood of hav­ing any child (the exten­ sive mar­gin).

On average, trade shocks differentially reduce employment and earnings of young adult males. Consistent with Becker’s model of household specialization, shocks to males’ relative earnings reduce marriage and fertility. Consistent with prominent sociological accounts, these shocks heighten male idleness and premature mortality, and raise the share of mothers who are unwed and the share of children living in below-poverty, single-headed households.

	abstract = {Robots have radically changed the demand for skills and the role of workers in production. This phenomenon has replaced routine and mostly physical work of blue collar workers, but it has also created positive employment spillovers in other occupations and sectors that require more social interaction and managing skills. This study examines how the exposure to robots and its heterogeneous effects on the labor market opportunities of men and women affected demographic behavior. We focus on the United States and ﬁnd that in regions that were more exposed to robots, gender gaps in income and labor force participation declined, reducing the relative economic stature of men. Regions affected by intense robot penetration experienced also an increase in both divorce and cohabitation and a decline –albeit non-signiﬁcant– in the number of marriages. While there was no change in the overall fertility rate, marital fertility declined, and there was an increase in nonmarital births. Our ﬁndings provide support to the hypothesis that changes in labor market structures that affect the absolute and relative prospects of men may reduce their marriage-market value and affect marital and fertility behavior.},

            Facing the same labour demand shock through imports from China, we show that men and women make different labour market and family adjustments that result in significant long-run gender inequality. The gender gap is driven by the female biological clock. Using population registers and matched employer-employee data from Denmark, we document that especially women in their late 30s, towards the end of their biological clock, decide to have a baby as the shock causes displacement. High-earning women in leadership positions and women who need to acquire new human capital are central because their new employment would require particularly high investments that are incompatible with having a newborn in the short time remaining on the biological clock. While children penalize women in the labour market, we show that due to the biological clock an otherwise gender-neutral shock leads to a gender gap in the labour market.},

A reduced-form analysis reveals that in response to local-area fracking production, which increased wages and jobs for non-collegeeducated men, both marital and nonmarital birth rates increase, but marriage rates do not. The pattern of results is consistent with positive income effects on births but no associated increase in marriage.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} The long-term decline in cohort fertility in highly developed countries has been widely documented. However, no systematic analysis has investigated which parity contributed most to the fertility decline to low and very low levels. {OBJECTIVE} We examine how the contribution of changing parity progression ratios varied across cohorts, countries, and broader regions in Europe, North America, Australia, and East Asia. We pay special attention to countries that reached very low completed cohort fertility, below 1.75 children per woman. {METHODS} Using population censuses and large-scale surveys for 32 low fertility countries, we decompose the change in completed cohort fertility among women born between 1940 and 1970. The decomposition method takes into account the sequential nature of childbearing as a chain of transitions from lower to higher parities. {RESULTS} Among women born between 1940 and 1955, the fertility decline was mostly driven by reductions in the progression ratios to third and higher-order births. By contrast, among women born between 1955 and 1970, changes in fertility showed distinct regional patterns: in Central and Eastern Europe they were fuelled by falling second-birth rates, whereas in the German-speaking countries, Southern Europe, and East Asia decreases in first-birth rates played the major role. {CONCLUSIONS} Pathways to low and very low fertility show distinct geographical patterns, which reflect the diversity of the cultural, socioeconomic, and institutional settings of low fertility countries. {CONTRIBUTION} Our study highlights the importance of analysing parity-specific components of fertility in order to understand fertility change and variation. We demonstrate that similar low levels of completed cohort fertility can result from different combinations of parity-specific fertility rates.},

However, the expected post-recession rebound in fertility rates has yet to materialize. In this study, I propose an economic explanation for why fertility rates have continued to decline regardless of improvements in conventional economic indicators. I argue that ongoing structural changes in U.S. labor markets have prolonged the financial uncertainty that leads women and couples to delay or forgo childbearing. Combining statistical and survey data with restricted-use vital registration records, I examine how cyclical and structural changes in metropolitan-area labor markets were associated with changes in total fertility rates ({TFRs}) across racial/ethnic groups from the early 1990s to the present day, with a particular focus on the 2006–2014 period. The findings suggest that changes in industry composition—specifically, the loss of manufacturing and other goods-producing businesses—have a larger effect on {TFRs} than changes in the unemployment rate for all racial/ethnic groups. Because structural changes in labor markets are more likely to be sustained over time—in contrast to unemployment rates, which fluctuate with economic cycles—further reductions in unemployment are unlikely to reverse declining fertility trends.},

The intuition behind such a relation is formalized by an optimal stopping model of fertility, where having a child is viewed as an investment. Its opportunity cost is modeled as a stochastic process, which changes are due to the displacement and productivity eﬀects of automation, the ﬁrst being assumed to concern routine workers the most. The model suggests that labor automation increases the value of waiting to have children for agents with a medium level of education, while it decreases it for those at the extremes of the education distribution. European panel data at the regional level are then used to give empirical support to the theoretical predictions, by constructing a measure of local exposure to industrial robotics. Higher exposure is associated with a postponement of fertility in regional labor markets with a high share of women with secondary education, and with an anticipation of it in regions with a prevalence of women with either primary or tertiary education.},

	abstract = {This paper examines a novel negative impact of trade tariffs and the costs they induce by documenting how protectionism reversed the long-term improvements in education and the fertility transition that were well under way in late 19th-century France. The Méline tariff, a tariff on cereals introduced in 1892, was a major protectionist shock that shifted relative prices in favor of agriculture and away from industry. In a context in which the latter was more intensive in skills than agriculture, the tariff reduced the relative return to education, which in turn affected parents’ decisions about the quantity and quality of children. We use regional differences in the importance of cereal production in the local economy to estimate the impact of the tariff. Our findings indicate that the tariff reduced enrollment in primary education and increased birthrates and fertility. The magnitude of these effects was substantial. In regions with average shares of employment in cereal production, the tariff offset the (downward) trend in birthrates for 13 years; in those with the highest cereal employment shares, there was a delay of up to 22 years.},

However, there is a lack of research that combines these strands. I ask to what extent male Western German workers and their partners’ ability to secure labour earnings that support a family has changed, and to what degree this was hampered by various adverse employment characteristics. Focusing on service and production workers with cohabiting partners, I analyse whether their individual and combined labour income is sufficient to support a family. Performing descriptive trend analysis and linear probability models with German Socio-Economic Panel data for 1985–2013, I compare class effects of four periods. I find that since the end of the 1990s, male service and production workers increasingly struggle to secure a family income—mainly driven by low wages and low work intensity, while partners’ labour market participation has gained relevance. The transformation towards the {AWM} coincided with a devaluation of the most privileged group among workers and thus the working class as a whole.},

	abstract = {Background
While fertility rates have decreased during the second half of the 20th century in Japan, little is known regarding trends in the number of children that men and women have across birth cohorts and whether these differ by education and income.

Methods
We used data from four rounds of the National Fertility Survey (1992, 2005, 2010 and 2015) and included men and women aged 40–49 years (16728 men and 17628 women). By 5-year birth cohorts, we assessed the distribution of number of children (0, 1, 2 and 3 or more) and total fertility (the mean number of children) at completed fertility (age 45–49 or 40–44 years depending on birth cohort). We assessed trends in these fertility outcomes in men and women separately, and by education (no university education; university education) for men and women and by reported annual income (0 to {\textless}3 000 000 {JPY}; 3 000 000 to {\textless}6 000 000 {JPY}; ≥6 000 000 {JPY}) for men.

Results
When comparing those born in 1943–1948 with those born in 1971–1975, the proportion with no children had increased from 14.3 to 39.9\% for men and from 11.6 to 27.6\% for women. This increase coincided with a decrease in the proportions of individuals with 2 or more children. Total fertility had decreased from 1.92 to 1.17 among men and from 1.96 to 1.42 among women. For men, those with a university degree were more likely to have children than those without a university degree in all birth cohorts except 1943–1947. Men with higher income were more likely to have children across birth cohorts. While the proportion who had children had decreased in all income groups, the decrease was steeper among those in the lowest income group. Among women born 1956–1970, those with a university degree were less likely to have children than those without a university degree; this difference was no longer seen among those born 1971–1975. For both men and women, trends in having children and total fertility across birth cohorts did not differ by educational status.

Conclusions
The decline in the total fertility rate in Japan can be attributed to both an increasing proportion of the population who have no children and a lower number of children among those who have children. Men with lower education and income were less likely to have children and the disparity in the number of children that men have by income had increased in more recent birth cohorts. Among women, higher education was associated with lower fertility, although this pattern was no longer observed among those born in 1971–1975.},

For men, personal income and personal net worth are positive predictors of both number of childbearing partners and fertility, while for women personal income and personal net worth are negative predictors of number of childbearing partners and fertility. For men, the positive effect of income on number of childbearing partners is because low income men are more likely to have no childbearing partners at all and not because high income men are more likely to have multiple partners. Men with a higher net worth do have more childbearing partners than other men, all else being equal. Both men and women who have a larger number of childbearing partners do have more children, all else being equal, although this effect is stronger for men than for women. Of those with multiple childbearing unions, men and women with both very high and very low incomes have more children than those with middle incomes.},

As expected, general trends in mean ages at childbirth are very similar among men and women. However, these similarities hide sharp gender differences in unexplored relationships between maternal and paternal ages at childbirth, which we uncover by deriving the mean age differences between the parents conditional on the maternal or paternal age. Between ages 20 and 40, the age differences become smaller for mothers in a strikingly linear manner; and larger for fathers. In recent decades, this linear relationship shifted, with younger mothers increasingly partnering with older fathers, and older mothers increasingly partnering with similar-aged fathers. Fathers, on the other hand, experienced decreasing age differences at all ages. We discuss the implications of our findings for fertility postponement and gender equality debates.},

Our approach is to relate marriage formation to the ease or difficulty of the career-entry process and to show that large race/schooling differences in career development lead to substantial variations in marriage timing. We develop measures of current career “maturity” and of long-term labor-market position. Employing discrete-time event-history methods, we show that these variables have a substantial impact on marriage formation for both blacks and whites. Applying our regression results to models based on observed race/schooling patterns of career development, we then estimate cumulative proportions ever married in a difficult versus an easy career-entry process. We find major differences in the pace of marriage formation, depending on the difficulty of the career transition. We also find considerable differences in these marriage timing patterns across race/schooling groups corresponding to the large observed differences in the speed and difficulty of career transitions between and within these groups},

	abstract = {Although females may require only one mating to become inseminated, many female animals engage in costly mating with multiple males. One potential beneﬁt of polyandrous mating is gaining parental investment from multiple males. We developed two game theoretic models to explore this possibility. Our ﬁrst model showed that male care of multiple females’ offspring evolves when male help substantially increases offspring ﬁtness, future mating opportunity is limited, and group size is small. In our second model, we assumed that males invest in the offspring of former mates and evaluated the ﬁtness consequences of female monogamous and polyandrous mating strategies. Females beneﬁt only from limited polyandry, that is, mating with several males. Polyandry is discouraged because females must share male investment with other polyandrous females, and paternal care is likely to experience diminishing returns. Females may enhance their access to male investment by competing with rival females and monopolizing investment, however. The results support the argument that females can gain paternal investment by mating with several males in small social groups (e.g., dunnocks Prunella modularis). The results do not support the argument that females can gain paternal investment from pronounced multiple mating in large social groups, however, as observed in many primate species.},

	abstract = {Spatial homogamy, or the geographical closeness of life partners, has received little attention in recent decades. Theoretically, partners may be found anywhere in the world, as increases in educational participation, affluence, mobility and internet access have reduced the meaning of geographical distance in general. This paper examines whether geography still matters in the Swedish partner market, by examining distances between partners before co-residence over time. Register data are used to track the residential histories (1990–2008) of couples who married or had a child in 1996, 2002 or 2008 (N ¼ 292,652). With the couple as the unit of analysis, the distance between partners before co-residence is explained by geographical, socioeconomic and demographic indicators. I find that although the distance between partners has increased over time, it is still the case that half of all partners lived within 9 kilometres of each other before moving in together. Demographic and socio-economic characteristics explain some of the variation in spatial homogamy, but geographical factors, such as previous place of residence, spatial mobility, degree of urbanization and nearness of parents, are crucial. Even in a globalized society, most people still find their partners very close by. The findings are relevant to the family migration literature, where residential mobility at the beginning of co-residence has received little attention, despite long-lasting consequences of partner choice on social ties and people’s socioeconomic careers. The results exemplify the importance of short geographical distances for intimate relationships.},

	abstract = {During the 2010s, Sweden, like other Nordic countries, encountered falling fertility rates. This was puzzling, since no structural processes, such as those related to the business cycle or social policy can explain the development. Based on register data, we show that the fertility decline was confined to first births in couples and that it was surprisingly homogenous across socio-demographic groups and regions of residence. Data from the Generations and Gender Survey in 2021 further revealed that it is the childless with a dire outlook on the future and a lack of trust in institutions who are hesitant to become parents. The Covid-19 pandemic seems to have brought another twist to Swedish fertility trends: Monthly data on child births during 2020-2021 suggest that the fertility decline came to a halt during the pandemic. We conjecture that Swedish fertility developments may reflect a “subjective turn” in childbearing considerations. The decision to have children seems less determined by factual circumstances and more by perceived (un)certainties and subjective imaginations of the future.},

Network members may then influence the agents’ transition to higher parity levels.

	abstract = {Social learning and life history interact in human adaptation, but nearly all models of the evolution of social learning omit age structure and population regulation. Further progress is hindered by a poor appreciation of how life history affects selection on learning. We discuss why life history and age structure are important for social learning and present an exemplary model of the evolution of social learning in which demographic properties of the population arise endogenously from assumptions about per capita vital rates and different forms of population regulation. We find that, counterintuitively, a stronger reliance on social learning is favoured in organisms characterized by ‘fast’ life histories with high mortality and fertility rates compared to ‘slower’ life histories typical of primates. Long lifespans make early investment in learning more profitable and increase the probability that the environment switches within generations. Both effects favour more individual learning. Additionally, under fertility regulation (as opposed to mortality regulation), more juveniles are born shortly after switches in the environment when many adults are not adapted, creating selection for more individual learning. To explain the empirical association between social learning and long life spans and to appreciate the implications for human evolution, we need further modelling frameworks allowing strategic learning and cumulative culture.

	abstract = {We study the structure of heterosexual dating markets in the United States through an analysis of the interactions of several million users of a large online dating website, applying recently developed network analysis methods to the pattern of messages exchanged among users. Our analysis shows that the strongest driver of romantic interaction at the national level is simple geographic proximity, but at the local level, other demographic factors come into play. We ﬁnd that dating markets in each city are partitioned into submarkets along lines of age and ethnicity. Sex ratio varies widely between submarkets, with younger submarkets having more men and fewer women than older ones. There is also a noticeable tendency for minorities, especially women, to be younger than the average in older submarkets, and our analysis reveals how this kind of racial stratiﬁcation arises through the messaging decisions of both men and women. Our study illustrates how network techniques applied to online interactions can reveal the aggregate effects of individual behavior on social structure.},

Preferences are a key component at the youngest ages. The role of other factors varies by age and time period. Contrary to widespread assumption, variation in cohort sizes resulting from past fertility trends is not the dominant contributor to partner availability during this period. Mortality and migration eﬀects tend to be larger than the eﬀect of birth trends and the two marital status components are generally the largest in size. Determinants of intercensal change are similar to the cross-sectional picture. Reasons for the modest contribution of trends in annual births are discussed. Cohort eﬀects on partner supply are not necessarily absent but could arise through a number of mechanisms.},

In recent years, the increase has been most notable in southern Europe – where up to a quarter of the women born in the 1970s may remain childless –due to weak family policies combined with persistent gender inequalities that make it difficult for women to reconcile work and family life.},

Speciﬁcally, I use a longitudinal data set to test whether and to what extent the intensive redistribution practiced by Israeli kibbutzim encourages exit of more productive individuals and entry of less productive ones. The ﬁndings support the theoretical prediction. Kibbutz-leavers are more skilled than both stayers and other rural migrants and they earn higher wages upon exit than observably similar city natives and other migrants. In contrast, individuals who earn lower wages in the city are more likely to enter a kibbutz, but they are not more likely to move to other rural areas. These ﬁndings also support Borjas' hypothesis that migrants' self-selection depends on the difference in returns to skills between the origin and the destination.},

	abstract = {Evidence from animal species indicates that a male-biased adult sex ratio ({ASR}) can lead to higher levels of male parental investment and that there is heterogeneity in behavioural responses to mate scarcity depending on mate value. In humans, however, there is little consistent evidence of the effect of the {ASR} on pair-bond stability and parental investment and even less of how it varies by an individual's mate value. In this paper we use detailed census data from Northern Ireland to test the association between the {ASR} and pair-bond stability and parental investment by social status (education and social class) as a proxy for mate value. We find evidence that female, but not male, cohabitation is associated with the {ASR}. In female-biased areas women with low education are less likely to be in a stable pair-bond than highly educated women, but in male-biased areas women with the lowest education are as likely to be in a stable pair-bond as their most highly educated peers. For both sexes risk of separation is greater at female-biased sex ratios. Lastly, our data show a weak relationship between parental investment and the {ASR} that depends on social class. We discuss these results in the light of recent reformulations of parental investment theory.

It is also a pressing social issue, because in many contemporary advanced societies, levels of childlessness have increased, and particularly so among men. The absence of a partner is naturally a fundamental determinant of childlessness. Empirical evidence on how childlessness relates to individuals’ partnership histories is nevertheless limited. This issue was analysed with Finnish population register data, which allow the complete cohabitation and marriage histories of individuals from age 18 years to be observed. For women and men born between 1969 and 1971, logistic regression models were estimated for childlessness at age 40 by partnership histories in terms of various stages in the process of union formation and dissolution, and accounting for several socioeconomic variables. A strong link between union histories and childlessness was found, with short partnership spells raising the risk of not becoming a parent. Later age when leaving the parental home raised female childlessness, while a short first-union duration related more strongly to male childlessness. These findings may be considered as providing insights into how specific life-history strategies affect reproductive outcomes, and highlight the need to develop new approaches to understand this feature of social inequality.},

The main material for this consists of georeferenced population data based on 1 Â 1 km grid squares produced by Statistics Finland for the period 1970–2000. An example is taken of one rural municipality where the georeferenced data were supplemented with qualitative interview material obtained in 1999. The results show that the number and proportion of young people in the population of Finland have declined since 1970, although not consistently, at the same time as the total population has continued to increase. The dichotomy between the sparsely populated rural areas and the built-up areas has been accentuated by a distortion of the population structure and gender ratio, in that the young people, and particularly young women, have been inclined to move into the growth centres and to the more densely populated areas in general. The georeferenced data clearly point to a worsening regional imbalance in the areal distribution of population in Finland, although the interview material suggests that the young people still living in the countryside do not regard their position as hopeless but are prepared to weigh up their future on the basis of the alternatives open to them.},

Thus, contemporary older adults (particularly the “young old”) belong to generations for which the proportions childless are near the minimum ever recorded. The article examines the factors associated with the changes in rates of childlessness, and more particularly trends in marriage (e.g., median age at marriage and the proportions marrying), trends in family formation (e.g., median age at the first birth and average family size), and the role of voluntary and involuntary factors.},

In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has partly displaced not only family and school, but also neighborhood, friends, and the workplace as venues for meeting partners. The Internet increasingly allows Americans to meet and form relationships with perfect strangers, that is, people with whom they had no previous social tie. Individuals who face a thin market for potential partners, such as gays, lesbians, and middle-aged heterosexuals, are especially likely to meet partners online. One result of the increasing importance of the Internet in meeting partners is that adults with Internet access at home are substantially more likely to have partners, even after controlling for other factors. Partnership rate has increased during the Internet era (consistent with Internet efficiency of search) for same-sex couples, but the heterosexual partnership rate has been flat.},

	abstract = {Previous research has typically ignored the spatial dimension of marriage markets, focusing instead on highly aggregated data or on individual models of entry into marriage. A basic premise of this study is that national marriage rates are played out across local marriage-market areas that define female opportunities for marriage. Using local area data from the newly released 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample (D file), the article provides a direct test of several alternative explanations of U.S. marital behavior and of black and white differences in marriage rates. The analysis reveals that (a)local economic opportunities (including welfare)for females, spouse availability, and urbanization contribute significantly to spatial variations is female marriage rates, (b) the lcoal supply of economically "attractive" males plays an especially large role in the marital behaviors of U.S. black and white women, and (c) racial differences in marriage-market conditions accentuate, but do not explain completely, black-white differences in U.S. marriage rates. The study reinforces the view that local marriage-market conditions play a fundamental and often unappreciated role in the marital search process of American women.},

This is the "life-cycle squeeze"-the situation where a man's resources are inadequate to meet the needs engendered by the number and ages of his children. Studies of how economic needs vary by family life-cycle stage indicate that one high point of need occurs when men are in their forties and early fifties. However, 1960 Census data on earnings patterns by age indicate that in only relatively high-level professional, managerial and sales occupations do average earnings peak at the same time family income needs are peaking. For most blue-collar and many medium- and low-level white collar occupations, median earnings are highest for younger men, and men at an age when family costs are at their maximum are earning somewhat less, on the average. As a consequence, the families of such men run the risk of a deterioration in their level of living unless an additional income is brought into the household.},

Our data covers all men living in Norway during 1970-2006 which allows for a detailed analysis of diversity along a wide range of different educational groups and cohorts. Childlessness among men is most pronounced among those with low education and least pronounced among those with high edu-cation, but at a given educational level, we also observe sharp contrasts be-tween men within different fields of education. The educational pattern of multi-partner fertility is different from childlessness, as the propensity to have children with more than one woman is most pronounced among those with low education.},

Using a multilevel, multistate competing-risks model, we examine the relationship between prior fertility outcomes (the presence and characteristics of children and current pregnancy) and the dissolution of marital and cohabiting unions and movements from cohabitation to marriage. Using a simultaneous-equations model, we model these partnership transitions jointly with fertility, allowing for correlation between the unobserved woman-level characteristics that affect each process. The analysis is based on the partnership and birth histories that were collected for the 1958 birth cohort (National Child Development Study) aged 16–42. The findings indicate that preschool children have a stabilizing effect on their parents’ partnership, whether married or cohabiting, but the effect is weaker for older children. There is also evidence that although pregnancy precipitates marriage among cohabitors, the odds of marriage decline to prepregnancy levels following a birth.},

Event history models that treat first marriage (prior to first birth) and first birth (prior to first marriage) as competing risks reveal modest but statistically significant effects of mate availability on the timing of both life-course events. These effects work in opposite directions in influencing the likelihood that a young woman will become an unwed mother. For White women, an abundance of eligible males in the local marriage market increases the rate of exist from the single, childless state both by hastening entry into marriage and by increasing the risk of nonmarital childbearing. For Black women, the percentage of males in the local marriage pool who are employed accelerates the transition to marriage, while the percentage of males in the respondent's secondary school significantly elevates the risk of a premarital birth.},

We found significant variation in sex ratios in age-groups 18–30 at the regional and sub-regional levels. Of the whole 20–29-year old population in Finland, almost 50 percent live in sub-region areas with a male surplus. As expected, a higher proportion of men compared to women appears to increase fertility of women in younger age groups. Contrary to expectations, high male-female ratios were not related to higher proportion of women living with a partner.},

We apply conditional logit models to show how patterns of assortative mating among never-married and previously married persons are subject to local marriage market opportunities and constraints. The results reveal that previously married individuals “cast a wider net”: spousal pairings are more heterogamous among remarriages than among first marriages. Marital heterogamy, however, is reflected in systematic evidence of trade-offs showing that marriage order (i.e., status of being never-married) is a valued trait for exchange. Never-married persons are better positioned than previously married persons to marry more attractive marital partners, variously measured (e.g., highly educated partners). Previously married persons—especially women—are disadvantaged in the marriage market, facing demographic shortages of potential partners to marry. Marriage market constraints take demographic expression in low remarriage rates and in heterogamous patterns of mate selection in which previously married partners often substitute other valued characteristics in marriage with never-married persons.},

These traditional practices are no longer compatible with the new gender distribution in education. The objective of this paper is to formulate hypotheses about the consequences for reproductive behaviour in Europe. I expect the following causal chain between the reversal of the gender imbalance in education ({RGIE}) and fertility: {RGIE} creates a new, education-specific mating squeeze that affects the process and expected pattern of assortative mating, which in turns affects the timing, probability and stability of union formation, which eventually is expected to have implications for fertility.

Nonetheless, the literature does not contain a clear definition of exactly what a marriage squeeze is and contains few quantitative estimates of its impact on marriage. The present article provides a precise definition of the marriage squeeze in equation (2), and applies it to measure both artificially produced marriage squeezes in two-sex nuptiality stable populations and the experience of the United States during the period 1950-1990. The marriage squeeze is shown to be capable of producing significant changes in both the level and distribution of marriage, and it appears to be having such an impact in some contemporary Third World societies. For developed countries in general and for the United States in particular, the marriage squeeze exerts little influence on the level of marriage but has a considerable effect on the distribution of marriages. The U.S. age-sex composition of the year 1978, compared to that of the year 1951, is shown to imply a 0.54 year decrease in the male mean age at marriage and a 0.53 year increase in the female mean age at marriage, as well as an 18 percent reduction in the variance of the male ages at marriage and a 33 percent increase in the variance of the female ages. The social and economic implications of such changes have yet to be fully explored.},

	abstract = {Even in the online dating era, individuals will seek intimate partners who live physically nearby. This paper considers the validity of different partner market measures in German {NUTS}‐3 regions; the often used sex ratio is contrasted with different versions of the availability ratio ({AR}) and versions of the partner market density ({PMD}). The paper discusses (a) how conceptional aspects of the partner market are reflected in the various indicators. Using aggregated population data provided by German statistical offices, (b) the partner market in Germany is described as measured by the different partner market indicators. Linking them to micro‐level data from the German Socio‐economic Panel, the paper (c) compares the effects of the various partner market measures on union formation. A simple sex ratio does not show variance over the life course or between cohorts, nor does it determine the rate of couple formation. The {AR} and {PMD} reveal more plausible distributions by age and cohort and higher criterion validity, especially when accounting for availableness according to marital status. With regard to men, the {AR} demonstrates the strongest impact on union formation; with regard to women, {PMD} seems more important.},

Current models describe the dynamics of only one sex (typically females). Such models cannot account for the sexrelated biases in dispersal and mating behavior that are typical of many animal species. In this article, we construct a two-sex integrodifference equation model that overcomes these limitations. We derive an explicit formula for the invasion speed from the model and use it to show that sex-biased dispersal may signiﬁcantly increase or decrease the invasion speed by skewing the operational sex ratio at the invasion’s low-density leading edge. Which of these possible outcomes occurs depends sensitively on complex interactions among the direction of dispersal bias, the magnitude of bias, and the relative contributions of females and males to local population growth.},

In the analysis presented here, the harmonic mean birth function is developed to incorporate size and sex speciﬁc fecundities. This structured birth function is compared with the harmonic mean birth function using both a hypothetical population and data for populations of the limpet Patella vulgata. A general expression to calculate the threshold value where the unstructured and the structured birth functions coincide is also provided. Using the structured birth function resulted in changes in population dynamics, growth rate, proportion of males and reproductive output. In conclusion, the choice of birth function is important due to its effects on the deterministic population characteristics, which in turn may have consequences for the managements of endangered or vulnerable species.},

Mating system is one of several population characteristics that may affect this. We use a stochastic pair-formation model to investigate the combined effects of mating system, sex ratio, and population size on demographic stochasticity and thus on extinction risk. Our model is designed to accommodate a continuous range of mating systems and sex ratios as well as several levels of stochasticity. We show that it is not mating system alone but combinations of mating system and sex ratio that are important in shaping the stochastic dynamics of populations. Speciﬁcally, polygyny has the potential to give a high demographic variance and to lower the stochastic population growth rate substantially, thus also shortening the time to extinction, but the outcome is highly dependent on the sex ratio. In addition, population size is shown to be important. We ﬁnd a stochastic Allee effect that is ampliﬁed by polygyny. Our results demonstrate that both mating system and sex ratio must be considered in conservation planning and that appreciating the role of stochasticity is key to understanding their effects.},

	abstract = {Most population dynamics models explicitly track the density of a single sex. When the operational sex ratio can vary, two-sex models may be needed to understand and predict population trajectories. Various functions have been proposed to describe the relative contributions of females and males to recruitment, and these functions can differ qualitatively in the patterns that they generate. Which mating function best describes the dynamics of real populations is not known, since alternative two-sex models have not been confronted with experimental data. We conducted the ﬁrst such comparison, using laboratory populations of the bean beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Manipulations of the operational sex ratio and total density provided strong support for a demographic model in which the birth rate was proportional to the harmonic mean of female and male densities, and females, males, and their offspring made unique contributions to density dependence. We offer guidelines for transferring this approach to other, less tractable systems in which possibilities for sex ratio manipulations are more limited. We show that informative experimental designs require strong perturbations of the operational sex ratio. The functional form of density dependence (saturating vs. over-compensatory) and the relative contributions of each sex to density dependence can both determine in which direction and at which population densities such perturbations would be most informative. Our experimental results and guidelines for design strategies promote synthesis of two-sex population dynamics theory with empirical data.},

This paper resolves the two-sex problem by replacing the fixed, age-specific fertility schedule of classical stable population theory by two basic relationships: a “birth matrix” and a “mating rule.” Placing certain restrictions on the birth matrix and the mating rule ({BMMR}), I establish that under certain plausible conditions, the {BMMR} model solves the two-sex problem by allowing matings and births to adjust to changes in population structure. The {BMMR} model thus provides an equilibrating mechanism in place of a fixed maternity schedule of classical stable population theory.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new set of tempo-adjusted period parity progression measures in order to account for two distinct implications caused by delays in childbearing: tempo distortions imply an underestimation of the quantum of fertility in observed period data, and the fertility aging effect reduces higher parity births because the respective exposure is shifted to older ages when the probability of having another child is quite low. Our measures remove the former distortion and provide means to assess the latter aging effect. The measures therefore provide a uniﬁed toolkit of fertility indices that (a) facilitate the description and analysis of past period fertility trends in terms of synthetic cohort measures, and (b) allow the projection of the timing, level and distribution of cohort fertility conditional on a speciﬁc postponement scenario. Due to their explicit relation to cohort behavior, these measures extend and improve the existing adjustment of the total fertility rate. We apply these methods to Sweden from 1970 to 1999.},

	abstract = {The relationship between female education and fertility is a long-standing topic in demography, our understanding of which continues to develop. Since the turn of the century, a growing body of research has documented cross-national variation in the female educational gradient in fertility, with mostly positive gradients in Western and Northern European countries. However, such national gradients may mask important variation in the educational gradient in fertility at the subnational level. This study is among the first to use large-scale individual-level administrative data to study regional educational gradients in parity-specific fertility in Northern and Western European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Adopting hazard models and model-based Synthetic Parity Progression Ratios, our results highlight considerable subnational regional variation in the educational gradient in first, second and third births. We conclude that, in addition to variation between countries, substantial within-country regional variation deserves to receive future scholarly attention. The documentation of regional variation in the female education-fertility nexus is a substantial extension of cross-national comparisons and contributes to the empirical and theoretical debate on the context-contingencies of the education-fertility nexus.},

Using harmonized register data, we compare cohort total fertility and ultimate childlessness by gender and educational attainment for cohorts born beginning in 1940 in four Nordic countries. Cohort fertility ({CTF}) initially declined in all four countries, although for cohorts born in the 1950s and later, the {CTF} remained stable or declined only modestly. Childlessness, which had been increasing, has plateaued in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Women’s negative educational gradient in relation to total fertility has vanished, except in Finland, while men’s positive gradient has persisted. The highest level of men’s childlessness appears among the least educated. In the oldest female cohorts, childlessness was highest among the highly educated, but these patterns have changed over the cohorts as childlessness has increased among the low educated and remained relatively stable among higher educated women. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, childlessness is now highest among the least educated women. We witness both a new gender similarity and persistent (among men) and new (among women) educational disparities in childbearing outcomes in the Nordic region. Overall, the number of low educated has decreased remarkably over time. These population segments face increasing social and economic disadvantages that are reflected as well in their patterns of family formation.},

This principle—the homophily principle—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of relationship. The result is that people's personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people's social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal environments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties between nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

Furthermore in countries with distorted fertility, the pattern of first births also exhibits an intense hump in younger ages, stronger than that of the total fertility pattern. This heterogeneity indicated by the recent fertility distributions of European countries and the {US} might be related to marital status, religion, educational level and differences in social and economic conditions. Additionally in the {US} this heterogeneity in fertility patterns might be related to ethnic differences in the timing and the number of births.

The penalized spline (P-spline) approach is particularly useful for these purposes, but it in small samples it can often produce implausible age schedule estimates. {OBJECTIVE} I propose and evaluate a new type of P-spline model for estimating demographic rate schedules. These estimators, which I call D-splines, regularize and smooth highdimensional splines by using demographic patterns rather than generic mathematical rules. {METHODS} I compare P-spline estimates of age-speciﬁc mortality rates to three alternative D-spline estimators, over a large number of simulated small populations with known rates. The penalties for the D-spline estimators are derived from patterns in the Human Mortality Database. {RESULTS} For mortality estimates in small populations, D-spline estimators generally have lower errors than standard P-splines. {CONCLUSIONS} Using penalties based on demographic information about patterns and variability in rate schedules improves P-spline estimators for small populations. {CONTRIBUTION} This paper expands demographers’ toolkit by developing a new category of P-spline estimators that are more reliable for estimating mortality in small populations.},

Accounts are given of recent research, relevant to prediction, in the mathematical description of mortality, nuptiality and fertility by age and duration variables. A systematic scheme for applying time relational models in this way is developed. The place of cohort methods is examined and it is concluded that their standard use for extrapolation of the level of fertility into the future is not justified in conditions similar to those in England and Wales. A procedure of cyclic projection of time period measures is proposed as an alternative.},

	abstract = {The ratio of men and women in the adult population, i.e. sex ratio, has long been recognized as a key demographic constraint for partnering behavior. However, the literature remains contradictory on how sex ratio imbalances influence partnering behavior, suggesting either higher or lower rates of male marriage being associated with male-skewed sex ratios. These contradictory findings are likely due to data limitations. Cross-sectional data or limited observation periods preclude studies from distinguishing sex ratio effects on timing from effects on the overall likelihood of marriage. In this paper, we use historical family reconstitution data to study the association of sex ratios with marriage patterns in the French colony of the St. Lawrence Valley in North America (1680–1750). The population experienced a substantial male-skew from sex-selective immigration during the early period of the colony. The long-running observation period allow for differentiating the timing and overall likelihood of marriage. Finally, the data enable us to study the effects of male-skews on the populationlevel as well as the regional and parish level. Cox proportional hazard models reveal that while male-skewed sex ratios are associated earlier marriage for women, the association with men’s marital biographies is less clear-cut. We find that men marry later when sex ratios are more male-skewed, yet we do not find a substantial reduction in the overall likelihood of marriage for men. Our findings reveal that male-skewed sex ratios do not necessarily result in an increase of never married men. We discuss the implications of our findings for the sex ratio literature.},

	abstract = {Objective This study analyzes whether the relative partner market position is a resource of power in couples' bargaining on the division of housework. Background Many studies explain men's persistently low housework contributions by their stronger relative economic resources in couples' exchanges. This article argues that a relatively higher number of alternative potential partners may act as an additional resource in this exchange because it affects the threat point of the bargaining process. Method Dyadic data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) are combined with partner market indicators from the project titled “The macrostructural context of the partner market: longitudinal dynamics” to estimate the effect of the relative partner market position on the division of housework by couples. Results A more favorable supply of potential partners to one partner than to the other corresponds to his/her lower housework contributions. However, a good relative partner market position is valuable for an individual's bargaining position only when he/she is also economically more attractive on the partner market than his/her partner. Conclusion The findings demonstrate the relevance of the partner market for dyadic processes in couple relationships and support resource bargaining approaches. Implications The exogenous impact of the partner market on housework arrangements implies that the empirically observed association between partner market imbalances and relationship stability are not mere products of endogeneity but represent real impacts of the partner market.},

	abstract = {In Norway, as in many other rich countries, childlessness is more common among men than women and has also increased more among men. Over the last 15 years, the gap in childlessness between 45-year-old women and men has widened from 5.8 to 10.2 percentage points, according to national register data. In the Norwegian-born subgroup, the gap has increased by 2.4 percentage points, from 5.8 to 8.2. The goal of the study was to identify the demographic drivers of this development, using a quite simple, but original, decomposition approach. The components reflect changes in relative cohort sizes, whether the child has one native and one immigrant parent, whether the father was older than 45, and whether one of the parents already had a child, no longer lived in Norway at age 45, or was unidentified. It was found that the modestly increasing sex gap in childlessness among the Norwegian-born is largely linked to changes in cohort sizes, i.e. fertility trends. Changes in re-partnership have actually contributed weakly in the opposite direction: It has become more common especially among men to have the first child with a partner who already had a child, and thus not contribute to bringing also that person out of childlessness. The importance of the various components is different for immigrants, among whom the sex gap in childlessness has increased particularly much. This development may also reflect that especially male immigrants perhaps have children in the home country who are not included in the Norwegian register.},

	abstract = {Many social inequality studies in modern societies take an individualistic approach. They analyse men and women as individuals and neglect marriage patterns and familial relationships. This often implies that men and women are all alike, that there are no important differences within households, and that employment chances and risks within the family are based on gender-free considerations. This article draws on the empirical results of several international comparative research projects to examine the impact of changes in union formation, the division of labour in couples and rising uncertainty in male breadwinner incomes on the development of social inequality between families in modern societies. The empirical findings support the view that such inequalities have grown significantly in the past decades due to the increasing accumulation of resources within higher qualified couples over the life course. This result would not have become visible in individualistic mobility or labour market studies. Beaucoup d'études menées sur les inégalités sociales dans les sociétés modernes ont une approche individualiste. Elles analysent les hommes et les femmes en tant qu'individus et ne tiennent pas compte des relations maritales ou familiales. Cela donne souvent l'impression que les hommes et les femmes sont tous pareils, qu'il n'existe aucune différence fondamentale au sein des foyers et que les chances et les risques d'emploi au sein des familles sont indépendants du sexe. Cet article se base sur les résultats empiriques de plusieurs projets de recherche comparative internationaux qui ont examiné les conséquences des changements provoqués par la formation d'un couple, la répartition du travail dans les couples et l'insécurité croissante du revenu de l'homme en tant que soutien de la famille sur le développement des inégalités sociales entre les familles dans les sociétés modernes. Les résultats empiriques soutiennent l'opinion que de telles inégalités se sont aggravées de manière significative au cours des dernières décennies en raison d'une accumulation croissante des ressources par les couples hautement qualifiés au cours de leur vie. Ces résultats n'auraient pas pu être déterminés par une étude de la mobilité individuelle ou du marché du travail. Muchos estudios sobre la desigualdad social en las sociedades modernas adoptan un enfoque individualista. En ellos se analiza a hombres y mujeres como individuos y no se tienen en cuenta las relaciones matrimoniales ni familiares. A menudo, esto implica que todos los hombres y mujeres son iguales, que no hay diferencias importantes entre los hogares y que las posibilidades de empleo y los riesgos dentro de la familia están basados en consideraciones neutrales desde el punto de vista del sexo. Este artículo recurre a los resultados empíricos de diferentes proyectos de investigación comparativos internacionales para examinar el impacto de los cambios en la elección de la pareja, la división del trabajo por parejas y la creciente inseguridad de los ingresos del hombre como ingresos principales en el desarrollo de la desigualdad social entre familias en las sociedades modernas. Los resultados empíricos soportan la opinión que dichas desigualdades han crecido de forma significativa en las últimas décadas debido a la creciente acumulación de recursos en parejas altamente cualificadas a lo largo de su vida. Los estudios de mobilidad o del mercado laboral individualistas no hubiesen llegado a esta conclusión.},

	abstract = {A large body of research focuses on the (socio)economic antecedents of marriage dissolution. Less is known about the factors that affect the stability of cohabitations. The focus in this study, which is based on Finnish register data, is on whether the socioeconomic resources of the partners affect the stability of cohabitations and marriages in a similar way. According to the results, a lower level of education, unemployment (of the man in particular) and the male partner's (or the couple's) low income increased dissolution rates in unions of both types. The stabilizing effects of each partner's high educational level as well as the male partner's employment and high income were stronger in marriages. The union types also seemed to differ in that the separation-promoting effect of the female partner's high (absolute or relative) income was stronger in marriages, but high-income women are few and the interactions between union type and the income of the female partner were statistically insignificant. The overall conclusion is that in the Finnish context, the socioeconomic antecedents of union dissolution are remarkably similar in cohabitations and marriages, but socioeconomic resources are somewhat more important for the stability of marriages. Only weak support was found for the idea that cohabitations are more compatible with income equality. Un grand nombre d'études s'intéresse aux antécédents socio-économiques des dissolutions de mariage. Les facteurs qui ont une influence sur la stabilité des cohabitations sont moins connus. Cet article, basé sur des données du registre finlandais, étudie si les ressources socio-économiques des partenaires affectent de la même manière la stabilité des cohabitations et des mariages. Nos résultats montrent qu'un plus bas niveau d'instruction, le chômage (de l'homme en particulier), et de faibles revenus du partenaire masculin (ou du couple) augmentent les taux de dissolution pour les deux types d'union. Les effets stabilisateurs d'un niveau d'instruction élevé pour chacun des partenaires, d'un emploi pour le partenaire masculin et de revenus élevés étaient plus importants pour les mariages. Les résultats différent selon le type d'union. L'effet positif sur les ruptures d'un revenu élevé (absolu ou relatif) de la partenaire féminine était plus fort dans le cas de mariage, mais le nombre de femmes avec un haut niveau de revenus est faible et les interactions entre le type d'unions et le revenu de la partenaire féminine sont statistiquement non-significatifs. En conclusion, dans le contexte finlandais, les antécédents socio-économiques des dissolutions d'union sont remarquablement similaires, mais les ressources socio-économiques ont un effet un peu plus marqué sur la stabilité des mariages. L'hypothèse qu'une égalité de revenus soit plus compatible avec la cohabitation se trouve peu appuyée par nos résultats.},

	abstract = {The decision to divorce may be affected by the characteristics of the local community. Community characteristics may be barriers to divorce, or they may increase the attractiveness of divorcing (e. g., access to a good remarriage market), but our knowledge of such influences is sparse. This study examines two such community-level factors: socio-economic conditions and the local marriage market. In this study, discrete-time hazard models with community-level fixed effects are estimated using register-based data on Norwegian first marriages during the period from 1980 to 1999, with longitudinal information on both the community and couple levels (N = 283,493). The results show that there are important community-level influences on couples' divorce risk, but these change dramatically when fixed effects are introduced. La décision de divorcer peut être influencée par les caractéristiques communautaires locales. Ces dernières peuvent constituer soit des freins à la décision de divorcer, soit augmenter son attractivité (du fait par exemple d'un marché matrimonial étendu), mais nos connaissances quant à ces influences restent partielles. Cette étude s'intéresse à deux facteurs au niveau communautaire : les conditions socio-économiques et le marché matrimonial local. Des modèles de risque à temps discret avec effets fixes pour les variables communautaires, sont estimés à partir de registres relatifs aux premiers mariages en Norvège pour la période allant de 1980 à 1999, et d'informations longitudinales tant pour la communauté que pour le couple (N = 283.493). Les résultats montrent que les caractéristiques communautaires ont une influence importante sur la probabilité de divorcer, mais la prise en compte des effets fixes modifie considérablement ces résultats.},

Competing hypotheses are tested. One hypothesis assumes that higher relationship quality leads to higher rates of childbearing, as a high-quality relationship offers the most favourable environment to raise children. An opposite hypothesis expects that lower relationship quality leads to higher rates of childbearing, as couples might have children in order to improve their relationship. Hazard analyses are performed using three waves of the Panel Study on Social Integration in the Netherlands. Findings indicate that positive as well as negative interaction between partners has a negative effect on ﬁrst- and higher-order birth rates. This suggests that couples are most likely to have children if they do not have too much negative interaction, but neither interact in a very positive way. Value consensus negatively inﬂuences higher-order birth rates.},

	abstract = {Opportunities for conceiving and bearing children are fewer when unions are not formed or are dissolved during the childbearing years. At the same time, union instability produces a pool of persons who may enter new partnerships and have additional children in stepfamilies. The balance between these two opposing forces and their implications for fertility may depend on the timing of union formation and parenthood. In this article, we estimate models of childbearing, union formation, and union dissolution for female respondents to the 1999 French Etude de l'Histoire Familiale. Model parameters are applied in microsimulations of completed family size. We find that a population of women whose first unions dissolve during the childbearing years will end up with smaller families, on average, than a population in which all unions remain intact. Because new partnerships encourage higher parity progressions, repartnering minimizes the fertility gap between populations with and those without union dissolution. Differences between the two populations are much smaller when family formation is postponed—that is, when union formation and dissolution or first birth occurs after age 30, or when couples delay childbearing after union formation.},

The objective of this study was to explore how three prominent explanations for sex inequalities in childlessness relate to the Sex Gap in Childlessness ({SGC}) in Sweden. The three explanations examined were sex ratio imbalance (more men than women), mismeasurement of fatherhood (inequalities in registration) and partnership differences (inequality in multi-partner fertility). Administrative register data for cohorts born in 1945–1974 were used. The population was restricted to men and women who were born in Sweden or arrived prior to the age of 15, and all registered childbearing partnerships were examined. To explore the possible significance of the three explanations, counter-factual standardization was used. Of the three explanations examined, the population sex ratio had the largest positive impact on the {SGC}, while multi-partner fertility had a negative impact. The results show that inequalities in the sex ratio can explain about 20–34\% of the {SGC} depending on cohort. Inequalities in registration of fathers explain about 9–24\% of the {SGC} depending on cohort. Finally, results show that women are slightly more likely to have multiple partners, and that this behaviour has a substantial minimizing effect on the {SGC} (minimizing it by 6–65\%). To the authors’ knowledge this was the first paper to estimate the scope of the impacts of these three mechanisms on the {SGC}. Differences in multi-partner fertility have in many instances been used as an explanation for men’s higher childlessness. This study shows that women have slightly more childbearing partners than men, and that this actually leads to a smaller {SGC} in the studied population.},

	abstract = {Obtaining cross-country comparative perspectives on male fertility has long been difficult, as male fertility is usually less well registered than female fertility. Recent methodological advancements in imputing missing paternal ages at childbirth enable us to provide a new database on male fertility. This new resource covers more than 330 million live births and is based on a consistent and well-tested set of methods. These methods allow us to handle missing information on the paternal age, which is missing for roughly 10\% of births. The data resource is made available in the Human Fertility Collection and allows for the first time a comparative perspective on male fertility in high-income countries using high-quality birth register data. We analyze trends in male–female fertility quantum and tempo differentials across 17 high-income countries, dating as back as far as the late 1960s for some countries, and with data available for the majority of countries from the 1980s onward. Using descriptive and counterfactual analysis methods, we find substantial variation both across countries and over time. Related to the quantum we demonstrate that disparities between male and female period fertility rates are driven to a large degree by the interplay of parental age and cohort size differences. For parental age differences at childbirth, we observe a development toward smaller disparities, except in Eastern Europe. This observation fits with expectations based on gender theories. However, variation across countries also seems to be driven by factors other than gender equality.},

Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities.

Examining these sub-national regional patterns might improve our understanding of national patterns, as regionally varying contextual conditions may affect fertility. This study provides for the first time for a large number of European countries a comprehensive account of educational differences in the cohort fertility rate ({CFR}) at the sub-national regional level. We harmonise data from population registers, censuses, and large-sample surveys for 15 countries to measure women’s completed fertility by educational level and region of residence at the end of the reproductive lifespan. In order to explore associations between educational differences in {CFRs} and levels of economic development, we link our data to regional {GDP} per capita. Empirical Bayesian estimation is used to reduce uncertainty in the regional fertility estimates. We document an overall negative gradient between the {CFR} and level of education, and notable regional variation in the gradient. The steepness of the gradient is inversely related to the economic development level. It is steepest in the least developed regions and close to zero in the most developed regions. This tendency is observed within countries as well as across all regions of all countries. Our findings underline the variability of educational gradients in women’s fertility, suggest that higher levels of development may be associated with less negative gradients, and call for more indepth sub-national-level fertility analyses by education.},

The effects of education in relation to the probability of marrying are positive for men, and negative for women. Generally, a low educational background is associated with low income and our results predict that elderly single men will tend to be of low socio-economic status.

These findings were contrasted with those from a separate sample of 66 heterosexual undergraduate women. Mate scarcity had no effects on women's sociosexuality or infidelity intentions.

	abstract = {There is great debate surrounding the demographic impact of China’s population control policies, especially the one-birth restrictions, which ended only recently. We apply an objective, data-driven method to construct the total fertility rates and population size of a ‘synthetic China’, which is assumed to be not subjected to the two major population control policies implemented in the 1970s. We find that while the earlier, less restrictive ‘later-longer-fewer’ policy introduced in 1973 played a critical role in driving down the fertility rate, the role of the ‘one-child policy’ introduced in 1979 and its descendants was much less significant. According to our model, had China continued with the less restrictive policies that were implemented in 1973 and followed a standard development trajectory, the path of fertility transition and total population growth would have been statistically very similar to the pattern observed over the past three decades.

All ﬁrst births are further analyzed by civil status of the parents, and non-married and married parents are compared. The study discusses the theoretical and methodological importance of distinguishing between age heterogamy (absolute age differences) and age hypergamy (gendered age differences) and examines changes in both measures. Results show that age differences in unions changed only slowly over the twentieth century. Age hypergamy decreased at a slow pace, while age heterogamy showed a u-shaped pattern with increasing heterogamy the last decades. These results are conﬁrmed in quantile analyses. Standardizations are also done to examine the inﬂuence of age distribution of ﬁrst unions. Trends for marital versus childbearing unions are similar overall.},

	abstract = {Conventional sex roles imply caring females and competitive males. The evolution of sex role divergence is widely attributed to anisogamy initiating a self-reinforcing process. The initial asymmetry in pre-mating parental investment (eggs vs. sperm) is assumed to promote even greater divergence in postmating parental investment (parental care). But do we really understand the process? Trivers [Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man 1871–1971 (1972), Aldine Press, Chicago] introduced two arguments with a female and male perspective on whether to care for offspring that try to link pre-mating and post-mating investment. Here we review their merits and subsequent theoretical developments. The ﬁrst argument is that females are more committed than males to providing care because they stand to lose a greater initial investment. This, however, commits the ‘Concorde Fallacy’ as optimal decisions should depend on future pay-offs not past costs. Although the argument can be rephrased in terms of residual reproductive value when past investment affects future pay-offs, it remains weak. The factors likely to change future pay-offs seem to work against females providing more care than males. The second argument takes the reasonable premise that anisogamy produces a male-biased operational sex ratio ({OSR}) leading to males competing for mates. Male care is then predicted to be less likely to evolve as it consumes resources that could otherwise be used to increase competitiveness. However, given each offspring has precisely two genetic parents (the Fisher condition), a biased {OSR} generates frequencydependent selection, analogous to Fisherian sex ratio selection, that favours increased parental investment by whichever sex faces more intense competition. Sex role divergence is therefore still an evolutionary conundrum. Here we review some possible solutions. Factors that promote conventional sex roles are sexual selection on males (but non-random variance in male mating success must be high to override the Fisher condition), loss of paternity because of female multiple mating or group spawning and patterns of mortality that generate female-biased adult sex ratios ({ASR}). We present an integrative model that shows how these factors interact to generate sex roles. We emphasize the need to distinguish between the {ASR} and the operational sex ratio ({OSR}). If mortality is higher when caring than competing this diminishes the likelihood of sex role divergence because this strongly limits the mating success of the earlier deserting sex. We illustrate this in a model where a change in relative mortality rates while caring and competing generates a shift from a mammalian type breeding system (female-only care, male-biased {OSR} and female-biased {ASR}) to an avian type system (biparental care and a male-biased {OSR} and {ASR}).},

	abstract = {The responsiveness of individuals to partner availability has been well-documented across the literature. However, there is disagreement regarding the direction of the consequences of sex ratio imbalance. Specifically, does an excess of males or females promote male–male mating competition? In an attempt to clarify the role of the adult sex ratio ({ASR}) on behaviour, here we evaluate both competing and complimentary expectations derived from theory across the social and biological sciences. We use data drawn from a historical, nineteenth century population in North America and target several life-history traits thought to be affected by partner availability: age at first birth, relationship status, completed fertility and longevity. Furthermore, we assess the role of various contributors to a population's {ASR}. We find that both the contributors to and consequences of sex ratio imbalance vary over time. Our results largely support predictions of greater male pairbond commitment and lesser male mating effort, as well as elevated bargaining power of women in response to female scarcity. After reviewing our findings, and others from across the literature, we highlight the need to adjust predictions in response to {ASR} imbalance by the: (i) culturally mediated mating arena, (ii) variable role of demographic inputs across time and place, (iii) constraints to behavioural outcomes across populations, and (iv) ability and accuracy of individuals to assess partner availability.

Multilevel logistic regression models show that, when faced with a relative abundance of agematched women in their community, Chinese men are slightly less likely to have intercourse with commercial sex workers, but are more likely to engage in premarital noncommercial intercourse and to test positive for a sexually transmitted infection. These findings are consistent with hypotheses derived from demographicopportunity theory, which suggests that an abundance of opposite-sex partners will increase the risk of early, frequent, and multi-partner sex and, through this, sexually transmitted infection risk.},

To address these concerns, this study evaluates the quality of men’s fertility data in the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}79 and {NLSY}97) and in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}). Comparing fertility rates in each survey with population rates based on data from Vital Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, we document how the incomplete reporting of births in different surveys varies according to men’s characteristics, including their age, race, marital status, and birth cohort. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on the {NSFG} data to demonstrate how birth underreporting biases associations between early parenthood and its antecedents. We find that in the {NSFG}, roughly four out of five early births were reported; but in the {NLSY}79 and {NLSY}97, almost nine-tenths of early births were reported. In all three surveys, incomplete reporting was especially pronounced for nonmarital births. Our results suggest that the quality of male fertility data is strongly linked to survey design and that it has implications for models of early male fertility.},

The unique characteristics of families with {MPF} present data and other logistical challenges to researchers studying the phenomenon. Drawing from recent studies and updated data, I present new estimates of {MPF} that show that about 13 percent of men aged 40 to 44 and 19 percent of women aged 41 to 49 have children with more than one partner, with a higher prevalence among the disadvantaged. Compared to parents with two or more children by only one partner, people with {MPF} become parents at younger ages, largely with unintended first births, and often do so outside of marriage. This article touches on the implications of {MPF} for families and concludes by discussing the theoretical difficulties in studying {MPF} and the challenges it presents to public policy.},

We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged men have the lowest chance of becoming fathers and the lowest likelihood of fathering multiple children in stable unions. Multipartner fertility, on the other hand, is positively associated with both disadvantage and advantage: higher-order birth risks with a new partner are more prevalent among men with low as well as high socioeconomic status. An intervening factor among disadvantaged men may be a higher union dissolution risk, and an elevated risk among advantaged men may be associated with their higher preferences for children and other features that make these men more attractive to women as partners and fathers of future children.},

Nearly 8\% of American men aged 15–44 report having had children with more than one partner, with sharp differences by age, race/ethnicity, and income—over one-third of poor black men aged 35–44 report having had children with two or more mothers, and 16\% report children with three or more mothers. Fathers of two or more children by multiple partners appear to be more disadvantaged than fathers with two or more children by the same partner. Multipartnered fertility is strongly related to prior birth characteristics; men not in a coresidential union at the preceding birth are more likely to have their next birth with a new partner, and controlling for prior-birth characteristics accounts for the elevated risk of Hispanics and blacks in baseline models. Results also suggest that multipartnered fertility is becoming more prevalent as younger cohorts transition to a new-partner birth more quickly and at a higher rate than older cohorts.},

Our analysis relies on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women (N = 759) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (N = 767). Our results are consistent with growth over time in the importance of women's earnings potential in determining their marriage prospects.},

While "like marrying like" is most common, a female emphasis on male economic characteristics and a male emphasis on female noneconomic characteristics lead to significant patterns of exchange. Nonblack (but not black) females "marry up" with respect to education, and there are significant interactions between a male's higher education and a female's younger age and between a black male's higher education and a nonblack female's race. The major change between 1969-71 and 1979-81 is a decline in the level of marriage, but the increasing economic role of women is associated with a reduction in the extent to which women marry men with more education. The marriage exchange thus reflects less inequality between the sexes as it becomes less common.},

It is contended that for this reason the exchange framework should be accorded explicit recognition. Moreover, it is shown that, when employed in a consistent manner, testable hypotheses as well as deductive explanatory theory can be generated. To illustrate, several testable relationships are suggested and a theory of homogamous mating is presented.},

In this article, we examine the relationship between educational assortative mating and income inequality in Denmark between 1987 and 2006. Denmark is widely known for its low level of income inequality, but the Danish case provides a good test of the relationship between educational assortative mating and inequality because although income inequality increased over the period we consider, educational homogamy declined. Using register data on the exact incomes of the whole population, we find that change in assortative mating increased income inequality but that these changes were driven by changes in the educational distributions of men and women rather than in the propensity for people to choose a partner with a given level of education.},

Nevertheless, the idea of "marriage squeeze" has continued in popularity, particularly in the English-language demographic literature. The "marriage squeeze" idea is based on the supposition of a certain rigidity in preferences for age of partner. Maire Ni {BHROLCHAIN} suggests here that demographers and sociologists tend to over-interpret the observed age gaps between spouses: age preferences appear to be more flexible than is commonly supposed. Evidence from England and Wales shows substantial variation through time in the joint distribution of partner ages, and no very substantial check to the marriage rates of large cohorts. Direct evidence on age preferences also suggests that the structure of male and female preferences is somewhat different from what is often assumed, implicitly by demographers and explicitly by sociologists.},

In this paper, we present a new data set describing local rental markets in France based on online ads collected through to webscraping. Comparison with alternate sources reveals that online ads provide a non biased picture of rental markets and allow coverage of the whole territory. We then estimate hedonic models for prices and rents and document the spatial variations in rent-price ratios. We show that rents do not increase as much as prices in the tightest housing markets. We use our dataset to estimate the market rent of each transaction and of social dwellings. In the latter case,this allows us to estimate the in-kind benefit received by social tenants which is mainly driven by the level of private rent in their municipality.},

Using data from English counties, the instrumental variable estimates indicate that: a 10 per cent increase in house prices leads to a 2.8 per cent increase in births among owners and a 4.9 per cent decrease in births among renters. Once calculated at the mean home ownership rate the net effect is a 1.3 per cent fall in birth rates. In addition, I document that the positive home owners effect is primarily driven by the older cohort and the negative price effect among renters is mainly driven by those aged 20-29. A further assessment of house prices and fertility nexus reveals that these effects vary by region and demographic subgroup. Taken together, the results imply that local real estate market conditions may potentially change the age structure and population dynamics of a country, including many emerging markets and transition countries.},

	title = {No Flat, No Child in Singapore: Cointegration Analysis of Housing, Income, and Fertility},
	abstract = {A key feature of the demographic transition in prosperous East Asian and other developing Southeast Asian states is fertility decline. Various pro-natalist policy measures, including baby bonuses and universal child care, have been undertaken by governments in the region, often with disappointing results. Like other social institutions in modern societies, housing can play a vital role in shaping fertility decisions, but its effect on fertility has largely remained unexamined. The ambiguous effect of housing affordability found in existing literature constrains the ability of governments to truly tap in to its potential to curtail fertility decline. This paper seeks to address this gap by empirically examining this often-neglected relationship between house prices and fertility rates. It examines the relationship through the mechanism of housing wealth formation in Singapore, a country with one of the lowest replacement levels in the region but also with one of the largest public housing markets in the world. It uses the resale price of public flats to test whether this wealth formation can potentially increase the likelihood of having more children. By doing a cointegration analysis of housing, income, and fertility, the paper confirms the “no flat, no child” belief prevalent among young Singaporeans. It finds a negative long-run effect: a unit increase in the prices of resale flats reduces the total fertility rate ({TFR}) by 0.0036, statistically significant at 1\%. Income is also found to negatively affect fertility. The variables included in the error correction model are also sensitive to disequilibrium. The resale prices also Granger cause the {TFR} both in the short and long run, and the effect is bidirectional. The paper emphasizes how imperative it is for policymakers to seriously consider this effect in crafting housing and population policies. Pro-natalist measures may prove inadequate if other aspects of family living in Singapore do not significantly change. Governments faced by a steady fertility decline need to consider how housing affordability can be used as an instrument to drive up fertility rates.},

However, recent research from the {US} challenges this view by emphasizing the wealth effects of increasing home values among owners. This paper examines the relationship between short-run fluctuations in local area house prices and fertility in England and Wales between 1995 and 2008, using individual-level data from a household panel merged to area-level data on house prices. Innovations relative to previous work are a focus on the precise timing of the relationship between housing market conditions and fertility responses and a systematic analysis of the differential effects of house price levels and changes. The results suggest house price effects vary considerably for different groups and point to the importance of the national contexts.},

There is widespread agreement that country-level institutional differences are the main factors behind the fertility differences among low fertility countries. {OBJECTIVE} This paper examines the relationship between housing, arguably the least studied of the key social institutions, and fertility across 35 low-fertility countries. {METHODS} Using newly compiled indicators of multiple dimensions of the housing context we explore housing from the perspective of renters, home-buyers, and lenders and sellers. We use 10 indicators of the housing context and combine them into five different indexes: renter support index, homebuyer support index, lender/seller support index, a combined index of all three dimensions, home ownership regimes based on previous literature. We operationalize fertility in terms of both the quantum (period {TFR}) and tempo (period mean age at first birth). {RESULTS} Analyses paint a complicated picture showing variation by quantum and tempo of fertility, across geographic regions (Eastern vs non-Eastern European countries), and reveal a weakening relationship between the housing context and fertility at the country level over time. {CONTRIBUTION} This study contributes to our understanding of institutional or contextual effects on fertility by 1) analyzing the relationship between housing and fertility over a 34-year period; 2) adding a supply side dimension to the conceptualization of housing context; 3) examining the association with measures of both quantum and tempo of fertility.},

Previous research from {AngloSaxon} countries implies that the social, political and economical interests of the voluntarily childless are in conﬂict with the interests of parents and that state subsidies and policies in support of parents could be considered as discrimination of childless people. However, in contrast to this previous research, the interviewees did not object to the redistributive tax system that beneﬁts parents or to the political ambition to build a ‘‘child-friendly’’ labour market where it is possible to reconcile work with parenthood. Instead they defended themselves against accusations for being ‘‘free-riders’’ who did not contribute to society by referring to the responsibility they took by paying high taxes. Notwithstanding, the informants criticized how some parents misused their beneﬁts and cashed in on them, making the voluntarily childless feel exploited. The article also suggests that state subsidies can eliminate some motives for voluntary childlessness but not all of them. The results add nuances to previous research as they highlight the importance of further investigating the relations between parents and non-parents in a social and political context.},

	title = {Does intelligence predict childlessness?},
	abstract = {Background: In many European countries, the rate of childlessness has increased and this increase is disproportionately large among men. It is thus important to study the antecedents of childlessness. Intelligence as a predictor of childlessness has received some attention, although the findings are conflicted. Men with less education, lower wages and no partner seem to be overrepresented among the childless. These factors are known to be associated with intelligence. However, little is known about how these factors may mediate the association between intelligence and childlessness.
Method: The present study analyzed data from the Young in Norway survey, which had been linked to the Historical Event Database ({FD}-Trygd) of Statistics Norway, in addition to intelligence scores from the evaluation for mandatory military service for all men in Norway. Intelligence scores were used as predictors of childlessness. Information on education, income and relationship history was retrieved from both the Young in Norway survey and the {FDtrygd} register. Mediation analyses with logistic regression analysis were performed in order to examine the direct and indirect effect of intelligence on childlessness.
Results: No linear association between intelligence and childlessness was found. However, follow-up analyses showed that higher risk of childlessness was associated with the highest stanine intelligence score (two standard deviations above the normed average), and that this effect was mediated by whether participants had ever been in a relationship by their late twenties. No significant direct effect of the highest stanine intelligence score was found when the question of whether participants had ever been in a relationship by their late twenties was included.
Conclusion: The present study revealed a complex association between intelligence and childlessness. The mediated association between the highest stanine intelligence score and childlessness was interpreted as an expression of delayed family formation. It is still unclear whether this delay in family formation will “catch up” if childlessness is measured at an older age, which raises the need for additional studies on the subject.},

An {OLS} regression of data from the 1994 {GSS} shows that high-income men have more biological children than do low-income men and high-income women. Furthermore, more educated men have more biological children than do more educated women.

Regarding income, the ﬁndings for both outcome variables are strongly consistent across all six countries. Highest-income males and lower-income females have the highest proportion of ever-married and the lowest proportion of childlessness (using a proxy for childlessness: own children in the household or not). There is no corresponding consistency of ﬁndings as regards education either between the sexes or among the countries. To conclude, a lower percentage of low-income men are selected by females, because for women male status and resources provided by men are important criteria in mate selection. Therefore a higher proportion of low-income men remain unmarried and childless. Thus selection seems to play a role in modern societies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Postponement of first births and an increase in childlessness are significant trends across European countries. While educational differentials for motherhood are well documented, this is less true for fatherhood.
{OBJECTIVE} To compare late first birth and childlessness trends in men and women, across cohorts and by education.
{METHODS} The analysis relies on French administrative data from the 2016 Permanent Demographic Sample ({EDP}). Ages at first birth and shares of childlessness are computed by educational levels and between cohorts from 1950 to 1970.
{RESULTS} Across cohorts, higher-educated women tend to “catch up” after delaying first births, while lower-educated women more often remain childless. For men, there is a slight catch-up among the higher-educated group, especially in the most recent cohorts, but not enough yet to offset the increase in childlessness. Childlessness also remains particularly high among the lower-educated group of men.
{CONCLUSION} Catching up after a delayed first birth is more frequent among men and especially women with more economic and social resources. While women are more biologically ageconstrained than men are, social barriers may also prevent individuals from entering motherhood and fatherhood at late reproductive ages.},

We look at the motivations of 939 nulliparous men and women, aged 25 to 44 years, who completed the Childbearing Questionnaire as a part of the study on reasons for childlessness. Individuals who were concerned about the negative aspects of child care (time, energy, financial costs) had the least desire to have children. Other motives were gender-specific: for women emotional aspects, especially related to pregnancy and infancy were important; for men—satisfactions of child rearing and traditional values of children. The role of fears and worries related to parenthood is discussed in details, as under certain circumstances it may concur with strong childbearing desire.},

	abstract = {Voluntary childlessness among women has been well researched, but the theories derived from that work may not apply to men. In this paper, we test whether or not female-derived explanations of voluntary childlessness are applicable to voluntarily childless men. We use {US} data from the National Survey of Family Growth to compare voluntarily childless men to other men and to voluntarily childless women in an effort to determine the distinctions between groups. We examine four long-held explanations of female voluntary childlessness and test their application to men: demographic, socialization, economic, and attitudinal differences. We ﬁnd that demographic and socialization variables predict voluntary childlessness in both men and women similarly. Traditional sex role belief decreases the probability of being voluntarily childless for both men and women, though the effect is slightly stronger for women. However, variables associated with economic theory do not predict voluntary childlessness for men. Most importantly, education is not a signiﬁcant predictor of voluntary childlessness for men, while it greatly increases the chances of being voluntarily childless among women. We conclude that new theories of voluntary childlessness need to be developed or existing theories reﬁned to take into account the gendered routes to childlessness—especially theories explaining the different effect of education on men’s and women’s childlessness.},

This study is based on the results of a baseline questionnaire answered by 191 men aged 20–50 years who attended two sexual health clinics in two major Swedish cities. The questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic background, reproductive history and fertility, but also two open-ended questions focusing on reasons for having or not having children. The results of these two questions were analysed by manifest content analysis and resulted in five categories: ‘(non-)ideal images’, ‘to pass something on’, ‘personal development and self-image’, ‘the relationship with the (potential) co-parent’ and ‘practical circumstances and prerequisites’. Reasons for having children were mainly based on ideal images of children, family and parenthood. Meanwhile, reasons for not having children usually concerned practical issues. The type of answer given was related to men's procreative intentions but not to background characteristics. In conclusion, men raised many different aspects for and against having children. Therefore, reproductive decision-making should not be considered a non-choice among men.},

They were also less religious and more politically liberal. For non-parents, level of desire for parenthood was negatively correlated with Independence and positively correlated with Agreeableness and religiosity. The ideal number of children desired was positively correlated with Agreeableness and religiosity. Childfree respondents who decided early in life not to have children (‘early articulators’) were signiﬁcantly higher in Independence and Openness to Experience than those who decided later in life. Motivations for childlessness loaded onto ﬁve factors, four of which correlated signiﬁcantly with personality traits.

	abstract = {Research on childlessness in contemporary society still focuses mainly on women. This article conversely examines childlessness among men in Czechia – a European post-socialist country in which becoming a parent was a strong social norm before 1989. This article asks how men’s explanations for being childless or childfree change over time and what this says about changing norms attached to parenthood in different historical and social contexts. It draws on an analysis of 24 problem-centred interviews conducted in two rounds about a decade apart on the same sample of child-less or free men. This approach is not usually applied in research on this subject. In the first interviews, the men’s narratives mainly reveal their different views on the impact the post-1989 social transformation had on their lives in relation to their perceived resources and life chances. The follow-up interviews show how the men’s views on their lives change with age, the different emphasis they place on free choice versus the effect of external factors over time, and the narrow line that they construct between ‘involuntary’ and ‘voluntary’ childlessness. The narratives of child-less or free men unveil that the norm of becoming a parent is growing weaker in Czech society, but age norms and the norms regarding pathways to parenthood are still strong. The article seeks to understand how Czech men construct their childlessness over time, thus contributing to the discussion of childlessness among men and filling the gap in knowledge on men’s childlessness in {CEE}.},

	abstract = {In this paper we address the question why childless women and men aged 35 years and older, who originally were considering having children, voluntarily gave up on having children. We hypothesise that this adjustment could be attributed to ﬁve mechanisms: adaptation to a lifestyle without children; resignation because of severe hindrances to having children; approaching the end of the fecund period; perceiving a low degree of social inﬂuence from signiﬁcant others to have children; and a low degree of personal persistence in pursuing life goals. We analyse data from the ﬁrst six waves of the German Family Panel (Pairfam) and employ multinomial logistic regression models. As the dependent variable we distinguished four types of sequences over the observation period: ‘‘permanently considering having children’’, ‘‘given up on having children’’, ‘‘switching’’, and ‘‘permanently not considering having children’’. Being female, being not employed, and having low scores on the emotional autonomy scale increased the likelihood of giving up on having children, while anticipating positive consequences of parenthood and perceiving inﬂuence from parents to have a child decreased it. The results show that all mechanisms addressed by the hypotheses were at work to a certain extent. In particular, the integration of personality factors and the importance of other life goals beyond parenthood provided valuable insights into the reasons for giving up on having children. Future research in this ﬁeld should focus more than was possible in our study on societal age norms and the role of partners in giving up on having children.},

However, there is little knowledge about how similar romantic partners are in these attitudes. Using dyadic panel data from German couples (sourced from pairfam), this study puts the degree of homogamy in gender role attitudes among young couples into perspective by comparing real couples with two types of counterfactuals. To create these counterfactuals, I re-mate couples in two ways: (a) randomly and (b) in such a way that similarity in attitudes between partners is maximized. Real couples differ only slightly from randomly mated couples, which suggests rather weak attitudinal similarity. Using longitudinal information, I further test the mechanisms that determine the degree of homogamy: there is strong evidence for alignment over time and for lower rates of separation among homogamous couples, but no evidence for homogamy as a by-product of assortative mating on other variables. This paper offers methodological and substantial contributions to the literature: it presents a method for intuitive assessment of the degree of homogamy with multiple variables simultaneously. It also shows that in Germany, macro-level diversity in attitudes largely translates into dissimilar attitudes between partners—with important implications for relationship dynamics.},

Few informants had considered their own fertility, and most were positive towards fertility treatment. The young men had inadequate knowledge about factors that can potentially impair male and female fertility. On average, the young men each mentioned three different factors they believed influence male and female fertility: (i) health behaviour; (ii) factors beyond personal control; and (iii) age. None mentioned sexual transmitted infections ({STIs}) but most appeared aware of the effect of increasing age on fertility. The results of this study highlight the need for educational strategies to improve young men’s knowledge about fertility and the factors that influence it, particularly about the potential adverse effect of {STIs} on fertility.},

Whether the choice to remain childless is more accepted for men or women is not a priori clear; we formulated hypotheses in both directions. Parenthood might be considered as more central to women’s identity than to men’s, resulting in higher disapproval of childlessness for women. Yet, as the costs of parenthood are higher for women, people might also be more accepting of their choice to remain childless and disapprove more of childless men. Multilevel analyses were conducted, including individual and societal-level variables. Our sample consisted of N ¼ 44,055 individuals nested in 25 European countries, obtained from the third round of the European Social Survey (2006). Subjective norms regarding voluntary childlessness were measured with a split-ballot design: half of the respondents were randomly assigned items regarding women choosing childlessness, and the other half was assigned items regarding men. Findings indicated that men were more disapproved of when choosing not to have children than women. Generally, this double standard was endorsed by women, not by men. Clear cross-national variation in the double standard existed, which was partly explained by the level of gender equality. We found that higher levels of gender equality were associated with larger double standards favouring women.},

This idea is tested with multilevel logistic regression models for 6305 individuals in 38 countries on all continents, using {ISSP} 2012 data. Measures for the average gender role attitude in the society as well as the dispersion in attitudes are regressed on whether individuals have at least one child or are childless. Attitudes are captured using factor analysis and are opinions towards the gendered division of given tasks and privileges, such as childrearing or the uptake of parental leave. The dispersion in attitudes is the standard deviation of the factor variable in the given country. The analysis gives support to the hypothesis: the greater the variation in gender role attitudes, the higher the chance for individuals to remain childless. The association is signiﬁcant and holds against various robustness checks.},

Data were analysed with thematic content analysis. Almost all participants wanted children in the future. Overall, there was a desire to follow the ‘right chronology’: get educated, having a stable relationship, employment and a good financial status before having children. While most men felt mature enough to have children, they were still not ready. Influences from within the inner social circle, societal expectations, the need for security and stability and being ready to give up freedom and individuality were factors that affected participants’ preferred timing of parenthood. Most men did not have suggestions for how earlier family formation could be supported.

Yet no comprehensive description has covered period trends in the prevalence of marital and nonmarital unions or partnership entry and exit rates across educational levels.
{OBJECTIVE} We describe period trends in the proportion of individuals in union and the flow of union formation and dissolution at ages 18–49 across educational levels for men and women in 1989–2019 in Finland.
{METHODS} We use register data with full histories of coresidential unions regardless of marital status. We calculate the age-specific yearly prevalence of marriages, cohabitations, and all coresidential unions, and rates of union formation and separation.
{RESULTS} The prevalence of marriage declined across educational groups. Increases in the prevalence of nonmarital cohabitation are slightly smaller than declines in marriage; as a result, the total union prevalence declined, especially among low-educated men and women. Union formation rates have declined since around 2010, and separation rates have increased notably, especially among the lower educated and in age groups below 35.
{CONCLUSIONS} The increase in nonmarital cohabitation has not fully covered the decline in the stock of marriages. The increases in union instability are notable. All observed trends and educational gradients are remarkably similar among men and women.},

	abstract = {In high-income countries, women increasingly remain permanently childless. Little is known about the relationship between childlessness and socioeconomic development in non-Western societies and particularly sub-Saharan Africa. At lower levels of development, poverty-driven (i.e., involuntary) childlessness may decrease with increases in levels of development, while at higher levels of development opportunity-driven (i.e., voluntary and circumstantial) childlessness may rise with development. Thus, we expect a U-shaped relationship between childlessness and development overall. We examine this idea for sub-Saharan Africa. We further contribute by differentiating between female and male childlessness; and between involuntary, voluntary and circumstantial childlessness. Moreover, we construct new indicators of subnational historical development to assess both inter- and intra-country variation, and distinguish between three components (health, education and income) to investigate the drivers behind the hypothesized U-shaped relationship. Using 291 Demographic and Health Surveys between 1986 and 2018 from 38 countries and 384 regions, we find a U-shaped relationship between female childlessness and development, and a linear relationship for men. The U-shape for women results from negative associations of female involuntary childlessness with health and educational advancements, combined with positive correlations of voluntary and circumstantial childlessness with education and income improvements. While these positive associations are stronger among men than women, the negative relationships of involuntary childlessness with health and education observed for women are absent for men, resulting in an overall positive and linear relationship between development and childlessness among men. Our findings have implications for how we might expect childlessness rates to evolve with future levels of development.},

{METHOD} We review the basic structure of the {TPB}, its principles, and its assumptions as they apply to fertility decisions. Among other issues we consider attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of control as antecedents to the decision to have a child; the expectancy-value model for understanding the formation of these antecedents; and the role of background factors, such as institutional policies, societal values, and personal characteristics. We illustrate key elements of the {TPB} using results from a multinational research project and end by considering a number of open questions for {TPB}-guided fertility research.
{CONCLUSIONS} We conclude that the {TPB} can usefully be employed to further our understanding of fertility decisions. By examining behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about having a child we can identify important considerations that influence this decision. The information obtained can also guide adoption of policies or interventions designed to encourage (or discourage) couples to have more children.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} While most studies analyze male’s and female’s employment separately, this study adopts a couple-level approach to relate paid work to childbearing in the United States. In addition, building on previous studies suggesting the existence of spillovers from others’ unemployment, I explore whether state-level unemployment rates moderate this association.
{OBJECTIVE} First, this study investigates how couples’ paid work, i.e., both partners’ combination of employment, working hours, inactivity, or unemployment, is associated with first birth. Second, the study tests whether this association varies depending on state unemployment rates across the decades around the Great Recession.
{METHOD} Using the 2003–2017 {PSID} waves, the probability of a first child across couples’ job constellations and aggregate labor market conditions is estimated using a linear probability model. A number of robustness checks are run, including fixed effects models.
{RESULTS} Both men’s and women’s unemployment similarly lower the probability of a first birth, as does the male breadwinner model. Full-time dual-earner couples display the greatest probability of a first birth. However, rising unemployment rates greatly reduce the advantage of dual-earners compared to single-earner couples.
{CONCLUSIONS} In a context of low public support for childbearing, couples tend to rely on the paid fulltime work of both partners to enter parenthood. Moreover, women’s work seems as relevant as that of their partners in shaping household childbearing decisions. Aggregate unemployment attenuates these differences, reducing the advantage of full-time dual work.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Gender equity theory in relation to fertility argues that very low fertility is the result of incoherence in the levels of gender equity in individually oriented social institutions and family-oriented social institutions. The salience of gender to the fertility transition is strong in theory but not as strong in specification of testable hypotheses, as has been pointed out in the literature.
{OBJECTIVE} The paper aims to clarify the specification of gender equity theory through a discussion of the difference between equity and equality and to suggest methods that might be applied to test the theory.
{METHODS} The theory is restated and further developed using literature from different disciplines. The method is described using a decomposition of fertility for women by human capital levels.
{RESULTS} The clarification of the theory includes a reminder that the theory relates to differences in fertility between countries and not to differences in fertility between women in the same country. In comparisons between countries, higher gender equity leads to higher fertility. In comparisons of fertility across women in the same country, higher gender equity does not necessarily imply higher fertility. In relation to measurement, a specification is suggested that effectively compares women across countries controlling for their level of human capital. Simple graphics are used to indicate ways in which fertility between countries may vary.
{CONCLUSIONS} The paper concludes that it is likely the gender equity theory can be tested more readily by examining the behaviour across countries of women with higher levels of human capital.},

The topic has a long history in the social sciences and has been the topic of a large number of studies, many reporting a negative gradient between intelligence and fertility. We link fertility histories to military conscription tests with intelligence scores for all Swedish men born 1951–1967. We find a positive relationship between intelligence scores and fertility, and this pattern is consistent across the cohorts we study. The relationship is most pronounced for the transition to a first child, and men with the lowest categories of {IQ} scores have the fewest children. Using fixed effects models, we additionally control for all factors that are shared by siblings, and after such adjustments, we find a stronger positive relationship between {IQ} and fertility. Furthermore, we find a positive gradient within groups at different levels of education. Compositional differences of this kind are therefore not responsible for the positive gradient we observe—instead, the relationship is even stronger after controlling for both educational careers and parental background factors. In our models where we compare brothers to one another, we find that, relative to men with {IQ} 100, the group with the lowest category of cognitive ability have 0.56 fewer children, and men with the highest category
have 0.09 more children.},

The United States shares many features of family change common elsewhere, although it is exceptional in its high degree of union instability. In this study, we use the Harmonized Histories to provide a rich, descriptive account of union instability among couples who have had a child together in the United States and several European countries. First, we compare within-country differences between cohabiting and married parents in education, prior family experiences, and age at first birth. Second, we estimate differences in the stability of cohabiting and married parents, paying attention to transitions into marriage among those cohabiting at birth. Finally, we explore the implications of differences in parents' characteristics for union instability and the magnitude of social class differences in union instability across countries. Although similar factors are associated with union instability across countries, some (prior childbearing, early childbearing) are by far more common in the United States, accounting in part for higher shares separating. The factors associated with union instability - lower education, prior childbearing, early childbearing - also tend to be more tightly packaged in the United States than elsewhere, suggesting greater inequality in resources for children.},

To capture the life course context of union dissolutions, I group union histories similar in timing, occurrence and ordering of events using sequence analysis. Eight well-clustered groups of union histories are distinguished. Four consist of life courses dominated by a long first or second union and display low levels of childlessness. The highest proportion childlessness is found among individuals who entered a first union late and dissolved it quickly. Groups characterised by long spells alone after a dissolution or many short unions also displayed a high proportion of childlessness. In contrast to findings from the {USA}, neither union trajectories nor their link with childlessness varies by educational attainment.},

	abstract = {A substantial amount of research shows that younger siblings perform worse than their older sisters and brothers in several socioeconomic outcomes, including educational achievement. Most of these studies examined stable families and excluded half-siblings. However, the increasing prevalence of multipartnered fertility implies that many children grow up in nonnuclear families. We examine whether there is evidence for birth order effects in this context, which offers an opportunity to test and potentially expand the explanatory scope of the two main theories on birth order effects. We use comprehensive Norwegian registry data to study siblings in the 1985–1998 cohorts born to mothers or fathers who parented children with at least two partners. We provide evidence for negative effects of birth order on lower secondary school grades in both cases. Children born to fathers displaying multipartnered fertility tend to have lower grades than older full siblings but perform more similarly or better compared with older half-siblings. For siblings born to mothers with the multipartnered fertility pattern, later-born siblings do worse in school compared with all older siblings. This indicates that negative birth order effects tend to operate either within or across sets of full siblings, depending on the sex of the parent displaying multipartnered fertility. We argue that these findings can be explained by a combination of resource dilution/ confluence theory and sex differences in residential arrangements following union dissolutions. We also suggest an alternative interpretation: maternal resources could be more important for generating negative birth order effects.},

While we find no significant differences across regions in the occurrence of multiple-partner fertility among fathers, our analysis shows striking variations in the prevalence and timing of {MPF} among mothers. Women living in the Atlantic provinces, in the Prairies and, to a lesser degree, in British Columbia experience a higher rate of multiple-partner fertility than those living in Ontario and Quebec. Regional differences in the divergent pathways leading to {MPF} partly contribute to explaining the observed variation across the country. Giving birth at young ages and in non-residential partnerships is associated with a higher likelihood of multiple-partner fertility, while repartnering after the breakup of the union in which the first child is born is more common in provinces where it is less prevalent.},

	abstract = {Background: Studies have suggested that {CMV} infection may influence cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) risk and mortality. However, there have been no large-scale examinations of these relationships among demographically diverse populations. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein ({CRP}) is also linked with {CVD} outcomes and mortality and may play an important role in the pathway between {CMV} and mortality. We utilized a U.S. nationally representative study to examine whether {CMV} infection is associated with all-cause and {CVD}-related mortality. We also assessed whether {CRP} level mediated or modified these relationships.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Data come from subjects \$25 years of age who were tested for {CMV} and {CRP} level and were eligible for mortality follow-up on December 31st, 2006 (N = 14153) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES}) {III} (1988–1994). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios ({HR}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI}) for all-cause and {CVD}-related mortality by {CMV} serostatus. After adjusting for multiple confounders, {CMV} seropositivity remained statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality ({HR} 1.19, 95\% {CI}: 1.01, 1.41). The association between {CMV} and {CVD}-related mortality did not achieve statistical significance after confounder adjustment. {CRP} did not mediate these associations. However, {CMV} seropositive individuals with high {CRP} levels showed a 30.1\% higher risk for all-cause mortality and 29.5\% higher risk for {CVD}-related mortality compared to {CMV} seropositive individuals with low {CRP} levels.
Conclusions/Significance: {CMV} was associated with a significant increased risk for all-cause mortality and {CMV} seropositive subjects who also had high {CRP} levels were at substantially higher risk for both for all-cause and {CVD}-related mortality than subjects with low {CRP} levels. Future work should target the mechanisms by which {CMV} infection and low-level inflammation interact to yield significant impact on mortality.},

	abstract = {Human beings tend to organize themselves in social groups with hierarchical structures. Leadership skills ({LS}) increase the chances of ascending to a higher rank in such hierarchies, which allows individuals to provide greater support for a partner and, eventually, a potential child. Research on the association between {LS} and fertility outcomes has been relatively scarce though. Our study increases the understanding of this correlation by exploring the prospective association of {LS} on completed fertility (number of children, childlessness) based on population data from Sweden. Poisson regression and Linear Probability models were applied for this purpose. Additionally, analyses using fixed effects models examine potential differences between within- and between-family considerations. Our findings demonstrate a positive association between {LS} measured at age of assignment to military service (17-20 years) and number of children by age 39 or later. In addition, men with lower {LS} scores are more likely to remain childless. Stratifications by potential mediators reveal that patterns are particularly clear among males of lowest income deciles, highest education, and those who have never been married. Males in higher income deciles, the lowest educational group, or who have ever been married do not have large fertility differences by {LS} scores. Further research is still needed for a better understanding of the personality-fertility link, e.g. whether personality characteristics are associated with the timing of childbearing, or whether similar results can be found in other cultures.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} During the 1920s and early 1930s, U.S. fertility declined overall but with large regional variations. Changes in foreign born populations explain only part of this. Differences in public health and poverty relief programs may further help explain these declines because of their potential impact on fertility determinants, in particular on breastfeeding and child mortality.
{OBJECTIVE} We investigate whether public health investments in child health (conservation of child life programs) and poverty relief (outdoor care of poor or charity for children and mothers) affected fertility for U.S. cities over 100,000 persons between 1923 and 1932.
{METHODS} We analyze data covering 64 cities between 1923–1932 that include birth information from the U.S. Birth, Stillbirth and Infant Mortality Statistics volumes and city financial information from the Financial Statistics of Cities volumes. Time and city fixed-effects models are used to identify the impact of public investments on fertility.
{RESULTS} Fixed effects estimates indicating the conservation of child life programs explain about 10 \% of the fertility change between 1923 and 1932. Outdoor care of poor did not seem to be related to fertility. Investments in charity for children and mothers were associated with fertility increases, possibly because poorer areas experienced relative increases in both higher fertility and charitable spending.
{CONCLUSIONS} Public spending on child health was strongly related to decreasing fertility in the U.S. during the 1920s, possibly because of increased breastfeeding and decreased child},

In this paper, we extend production function models of economic growth to account for two additional variables that microeconomists have identified as fundamental components of human capital: work experience and health. Our main result is that good health has a positive, sizable, and statistically significant effect on aggregate output. We find little variation across countries in average work experience, thus differentials in work experience account for little variation in rates of economic growth. Finally, we find that the effects of average schooling on national output are consistent with microeconomic estimates of the effects of individual schooling on earnings, suggesting that education creates no discernible externalities.},

	abstract = {In 1990, German uniﬁcation led to an abrupt and extensive restructuring of the educational system and economy of the German Democratic Republic ({GDR}) as the latter was reintegrated into the Federal Republic of Germany ({FRG}). However, the consequences of this large-scale institutional change for the educational inequality between children from different social class backgrounds in East Germany continue to be poorly understood. This article seeks to shed new light on this question by using a quasi-experimental approach to examine the difference in educational inequality between East and West Germany before and after German uniﬁcation. We compare changes in the class gradient in the attainment of comparable school and university qualiﬁcations in East and West Germany across six birth cohorts, including three cohorts of individuals who completed their schooling after uniﬁcation. We ﬁnd that before uniﬁcation, inequality of educational opportunity at the mid-secondary, upper-secondary and tertiary level was substantially lower in East Germany than in West Germany and that uniﬁcation led to a substantial and sustained convergence of the level of inequality of educational opportunity in East Germany towards that of West Germany.},

	abstract = {Delayed parenthood is a central feature of the massive transformation of family and reproduction in rich countries. We analyse the shift of motherhood towards later reproductive ages during the last four decades and review its consequences for children and their mothers in low-fertility countries in Europe, North America, Oceania and East Asia. First we analyse the trends in birth rates at advanced reproductive ages (35+), including trends at very high reproductive ages (50+) and detailing the rapid rise in first and second birth rates at that ages. We show that a relatively high share of childless women and of women with one child aged 35-44 still plan to have a(nother) child in the future. Subsequently, we discuss the limited success rates of assisted reproduction at advanced reproductive ages and its contribution to parenthood at later ages. Next we outline the key drivers of delayed parenthood and its demographic consequences. Finally, we briefly review the consequences of delayed motherhood for pregnancy outcomes, maternal and child health and highlight selected positive consequences of later parenthood for mothers and children. We argue that economic and social rationales for late reproduction clash with the biological and health rationales for having children earlier in life.},

Our study’s purpose was to empirically examine how perceptions of childbearing deadline age vary in association with availability and prevalence of {ART} across different countries. The present study used data from the 2006 European Social Survey and the 2006 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology to examine selected {EU} countries. A total sample of 17,487 respondents was examined. Multilevel regression modeling was used. Results showed that ﬁrst, younger generations were more generous with maternal childbearing ages but stricter with paternal deadline ages. Second, respondents residing in countries with higher percentage of reproductive clinics per population were more generous with maternal ages, however no signiﬁcant association was observed with regard to paternal childbearing ages. Third, on the contrary, respondents residing in countries with higher utilization of {ART} treatments were stricter with maternal ages, which may be because they are more likely to be aware of the physiological and ﬁnancial difﬁculties associated with {ART} treatments. The present study is meaningful in that it is the ﬁrst study to empirically examine social perceptions of childbearing ages in relation with {ART}.},

Postponement is recuperated to a larger extent in countries with relatively high fertility, less in countries with very low fertility. Explanations have referred to social policy and socioeconomic context. We argue that cultural factors also need to be taken into account and investigate the relationship between age norms and second birth rates in 23 European countries. Using the third round of the European Social Survey we analyze if ideas about the ‘proper’ age for parenthood interact with actual ages at first birth in influencing second birth transitions. Our findings indicate that in regions with older ideal ages for parenthood the second birth rate is depressed for women with young ages at first birth, and vice versa. This effect, however, is strongly reduced and remains only marginally significant after controlling for an interaction between regional {GDP} and age at first birth. This indicates that rich regions exhibit weaker postponement effects, and that this relationship largely absorbs the effect of age norms. We also find that the negative effect of high age at first birth on the second birth rates attenuates with educational attainment.},

Here we argue that studies have overlooked evidence for variation in male reproductive ageing across human populations. We apply a Bayesian approach to census data from Agta hunter-gatherers and Gambian farmers to show that long post-reproductive lifespans characterise not only women but also males in some traditional human populations. We calculate three indices of reproductive ageing in men (oldest age at reproduction, male late-life reproduction, and post-reproductive representation) and identify a continuum of male reproductive longevity across eight traditional societies ranging from !Kung, Hadza and Agta hunter-gatherers exhibiting low levels of polygyny, early age at last reproduction and long post-reproductive lifespans, to male Gambian agriculturalists and Turkana pastoralists showing higher levels of polygyny, late-life reproduction and shorter postreproductive lifespans. We conclude that the uniquely human detachment between rates of somatic senescence and reproductive decline, and the existence of post-reproductive lifespans, are features of both male and female life histories, and therefore not exclusive consequences of menopause.},

The qualitative approach of our study allows for gaining insights into how age norms are explained, argued about and sanctioned. Finally, we reconstruct the mechanisms of the normative inﬂuence of age limits (deadlines) on fertility behaviour, improving our understanding of the timing of childbearing.},

	abstract = {Central and Eastern Europe ({CEE}) have experienced considerable instability in mortality since the 1960s. Long periods of stagnating life expectancy were followed by rapid increases in life expectancy and, in some cases, even more rapid declines, before more recent periods of improvement. These trends have been well documented, but to date, no study has comprehensively explored trends in lifespan variation. We improved such analyses by incorporating life disparity as a health indicator alongside life expectancy, examining trends since the 1960s for 12 countries from the region. Generally, life disparity was high and fluctuated strongly over the period. For nearly 30 of these years, life expectancy and life disparity varied independently of each other, largely because mortality trends ran in opposite directions over different ages. Furthermore, we quantified the impact of large classes of diseases on life disparity trends since 1994 using a newly harmonized cause-of-death time series for eight countries in the region. Mortality patterns in {CEE} countries were heterogeneous and ran counter to the common patterns observed in most developed countries.

              The {COVID}-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented rise in mortality that translated into life expectancy losses around the world, with only a few exceptions. We estimate life expectancy changes in 29 countries since 2020 (including most of Europe, the United States and Chile), attribute them to mortality changes by age group and compare them with historic life expectancy shocks. Our results show divergence in mortality impacts of the pandemic in 2021. While countries in western Europe experienced bounce backs from life expectancy losses of 2020, eastern Europe and the United States witnessed sustained and substantial life expectancy deficits. Life expectancy deficits during fall/winter 2021 among people ages 60+ and {\textless}60 were negatively correlated with measures of vaccination uptake across countries (

In contrast to 2020, the age profile of excess mortality in 2021 was younger, with those in under-80 age groups contributing more to life expectancy losses. However, even in 2021, registered {COVID}-19 deaths continued to account for most life expectancy losses.},

We show that, for this purpose, the random effects linear probability model is preferable to a random effects non-linear probability model, such as a logit or probit. This is because, for a binary outcome, the {ICC} derived from a random effects linear probability model is a non-parametric estimate of the {ICC}, equivalent to a statistic called Cohen’s j. Furthermore, because j can be calculated when the outcome has more than two categories, we can use the random effects linear probability model to compute a single {ICC} in cases with more than two outcome categories. Lastly, {ICCs} are often compared between groups to show the degree to which sibling differences vary between groups: we show that when the outcome is categorical these comparisons are invalid. We suggest alternative measures for this purpose.},

The discrepancy occurs because the computational algorithms used to apply the best multiple imputation models have been slow, difficult to implement, impossible to run with existing commercial statistical packages, and have demanded considerable expertise. We adapt an algorithm and use it to implement a general-purpose, multiple imputation model for missing data. This algorithm is considerably faster and easier to use than the leading method recommended in the statistics literature. We also quantify the risks of current missing data practices, illustrate how to use the new procedure, and evaluate this alternative through simulated data as well as actual empirical examples. Finally, we offer easy-to-use software that implements all methods discussed.},

{OBJECTIVE} We investigate the link between public childcare and {FLP}, using different indicators of childcare and accounting for heterogeneous time trends and regional heterogeneity.
{METHODS} Based on a balanced panel of all German counties from 2007 to 2017, we estimate the effect of an increasing enrollment rate for children aged 0–2 and 3–5 on {FLP}. We compare fixed effect ({FE}) and fixed effect individual slope estimators ({FEIS}) to control for county-specific time trends. Subsequently, we compare the results across regions with different levels of urbanization.
{RESULTS} We find that most {FE} results are biased due to selection on trends. Still, when accounting for selection on trends, childcare enrollment for the age group 0–2 increases {FLP} in West Germany and in urban areas. Furthermore, childcare enrollment for children aged 3–5 years is associated with higher {FLP} in West Germany, in rural and, most strongly, in metropolitan areas.
{CONCLUSIONS} Our study highlights important heterogeneity in the general time trends of {FLP} and the effectiveness of childcare arrangements across different regions in Germany.},

Using data from two rounds of the European Social Survey, we investigate these changes and their association with macro-level fertility indicators in 21 countries. Between 2006–07 and 2018–19, consensus regarding the existence of age norms remained strong and became more in favour of later parenthood. Decomposition analyses show that shifts in age norms were only partially driven by the changing population composition, providing support to the idea that a general attitudinal change in favour of later childbearing is underway. Our findings support gender convergence in upper social age limits because of the increasing recognition of a deadline for men’s childbearing. Although shifts in age norms are occurring in times of fertility postponement, they are only loosely associated with changes in fertility behaviours.},

              {INTRODUCTION}
              The epidemic of substance use disorders and drug overdose deaths is a growing public health crisis in the United States. Every day, 174 people die from drug overdoses. Currently, opioids (including prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and its chemical analogs) are the leading cause of overdose deaths. The overdose mortality data can reveal the complex and evolving dynamics of drug use in the United States.
            
            
              {RATIONALE}
              Reports on the U.S. drug overdose epidemic tend to focus on changes in yearly statistics. Improved understanding of the long-term dynamics of the overdose epidemic may aid in the development of more effective epidemic prevention and control strategies. At present, there are no reliable methods to forecast the likely future course of the epidemic. We focused on deaths from overdoses as a relatively reliable metric of the epidemic because all deaths are required to be reported in all U.S. states and territories using the standardized International Classification of Diseases. In an effort to understand the epidemic dynamics and perhaps predict its future course, we analyzed records of 599,255 deaths from 1979 through 2016 from the National Vital Statistics System where unintentional drug poisoning was identified as the main cause of death. We examined the time course of the overall number of deaths; the contributions of individual drugs (prescription opioids, heroin, synthetic opioids like fentanyl, methadone, cocaine, methamphetamine) to the overall curve; changes in the populations most affected by each drug as measured by demographic factors of age, sex, race, and urbanicity; and changes in the geographic distribution of deaths due to each drug as measured by the county of residence of each decedent.
            
            
              {RESULTS}
              
                The overall mortality rate for unintentional drug poisonings in the United States grew exponentially from 1979 through 2016. This exponentially increasing mortality rate has tracked along a remarkably smooth trajectory (log linear
                R
                2
                = 0.99) for at least 38 years (left panel). By contrast, the trajectories of mortality rates from individual drugs have not tracked along exponential trajectories. Cocaine was a leading cause in 2005–2006, which was overtaken successively by prescription opioids, then heroin, and then synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. The demographic patterns of deaths due to each drug have also shown substantial variability over time. Until 2010, most deaths were in 40- to 50-year-old persons, from cocaine and increasingly from prescription drugs. Deaths from heroin and then fentanyl have subsequently predominated, affecting younger persons, ages 20 to 40 (middle panel). Mortality rates for males have exceeded those for females for all drugs. Rates for whites exceeded those for blacks for all opioids, but rates were much greater among blacks for cocaine. Death rates for prescription drugs were greater for rural than urban populations. The geographic patterns of deaths also vary by drug. Prescription opioid deaths are widespread across the United States (right panel), whereas heroin and fentanyl deaths are predominantly located in the northeastern United States and methamphetamine deaths in the southwestern United States. Cocaine deaths tend to be associated with urban centers. The online manuscript provides many details of the patterns of mortality in these data.
              
            
            
              {CONCLUSION}
              The U.S. drug overdose epidemic has been inexorably tracking along an exponential growth curve since at least 1979. Although there have been transient periods of minor acceleration or deceleration, the overall drug overdose mortality rate has regularly returned to the exponential growth curve. This historical pattern of predictable growth for at least 38 years suggests that the current opioid epidemic may be a more recent manifestation of an ongoing longer-term process. This process may continue along this path for several more years into the future. Paradoxically, there has been substantial variability with which specific drugs have become dominant in varying populations and geographic locales. This variability all but negates the possibility of confident predictions about the future role of specific drugs. Indeed, it is possible that a future overdose epidemic may be driven by a new or obscure drug that is not among the leading causes of drug overdose death today. Understanding the forces that are holding multiple subepidemics together onto a smooth exponential trajectory may be important in revealing, and effectively dealing with, the root causes of the epidemic.
              
                
                  Exponential growth in overdose deaths.
                  The smooth overall U.S. overdose mortality curve (left panel) is a composite of multiple subepidemics, as revealed by changing patterns of overdose deaths by age distribution (middle panel; color indicates deaths per 100,000 persons), and by geography (right panel; color shows hotspots), for prescription opioids (upper) and heroin (lower). Subepidemic patterns for other drugs are shown in the full manuscript.

            Better understanding of the dynamics of the current U.S. overdose epidemic may aid in the development of more effective prevention and control strategies. We analyzed records of 599,255 deaths from 1979 through 2016 from the National Vital Statistics System in which accidental drug poisoning was identified as the main cause of death. By examining all available data on accidental poisoning deaths back to 1979 and showing that the overall 38-year curve is exponential, we provide evidence that the current wave of opioid overdose deaths (due to prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) may just be the latest manifestation of a more fundamental longer-term process. The 38+ year smooth exponential curve of total U.S. annual accidental drug poisoning deaths is a composite of multiple distinctive subepidemics of different drugs (primarily prescription opioids, heroin, methadone, synthetic opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine), each with its own specific demographic and geographic characteristics.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates comparative patterns of fertility in new Hispanic destinations and established gateways using pooled cross-sectional data from the 2005–2009 microdata files of the American Community Survey. Changing Hispanic fertility provides a useful indicator of cultural incorporation. Analyses show that high fertility among Hispanics has been driven in part by the Mexican origin and other new immigrant populations (e.g., non-citizens, those with poor English language skills, etc.). However, high fertility rates among Hispanics cannot be explained entirely by sociodemographical characteristics that place them at higher risk of fertility. For 2005–2009, Hispanic fertility rates were 48 percent higher than fertility among whites; they were roughly 25 percent higher after accounting for differences in key social characteristics, such as age, nativity, country of origin, and education. Contrary to most previous findings of spatial assimilation among in-migrants, fertility rates among Hispanics in new destinations exceeded fertility in established gateways by 18 percent. In the multivariate analyses, Hispanics in new destinations were roughly 10 percent more likely to have had a child in the past year than those living in established gateways. Results are consistent with subcultural explanations of Hispanic fertility and raise new questions about the spatial patterning of assimilation and the formation of ethnic enclaves outside traditional settlement areas.},

	abstract = {After decades of robust growth, the rise in {US} life expectancy stalled after 2010. Explanations for the stall have focused on rising drug-related deaths. Here we show that a stagnating decline in cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) mortality was the main culprit, outpacing and overshadowing the effects of all other causes of death. The {CVD} stagnation held back the increase of {US} life expectancy at age 25 y by 1.14 y in women and men, between 2010 and 2017. Rising drug-related deaths had a much smaller effect: 0.1 y in women and 0.4 y in men. Comparisons with other high-income countries reveal that the {US} {CVD} stagnation is unusually strong, contributing to a stark mortality divergence between the {US} and peer nations. Without the aid of {CVD} mortality declines, future {US} life expectancy gains must come from other causes—a monumental task given the enormity of earlier declines in {CVD} death rates. Reversal of the drug overdose epidemic will be beneficial, but insufficient for achieving pre-2010 pace of life expectancy growth.},

	abstract = {Education and fertility (including childrearing) are foundational processes in societal metabolism, and the relationship between them can have profound, long-term effects on a variety of institutions, including the labor market, the family (especially care for the elderly), and educational institutions themselves. In postindustrial countries, conventional wisdom holds that there is a strong inverse relationship between education and completed fertility, but this has not been carefully examined in recent decades, and the topic has been almost completely neglected for men. In this article, we address these core questions and relations, drawing on the Norwegian population registers for cohorts born 1940 to 1964. Among women, the relationship between completed fertility and educational level attained at age 39 has become substantially less negative. In all cohorts, better-educated women have later first births and remain childless more often than do the less educated. The negative effect of education on higher-order birth rates net of the impact of later motherhood has, however, disappeared. Family-friendly ideologies and policies, including better access to high-quality daycare, are likely the engine behind this shift. Among men, a positive relationship has emerged: the better educated become fathers later than others, but fewer remain childless, and there has been an increasingly stimulating effect of education on second- and third-birth rates. We discuss these sex differences in light of the persistent differences between mothers' and fathers' roles.},

The consequent data represent a challenge to conventional analysis, for example, the service that provided the data used in this paper had approximately 5,000 users all of whom completed an extensive questionnaire resulting in some 300 parameters. This creates an opportunity to apply innovative analytical techniques that may provide new sociological insights into complex data. In this paper we utilise the self-organising map ({SOM}), an unsupervised neural network methodology, to explore Internet dating data. The resulting visual maps are used to demonstrate the ability of {SOMs} to reveal interrelated parameters. The {SOM} process led to the emergence of correlations that were obscured in the original data and pointed to the role of what we call 'cultural age' in the profiles and partnership preferences of the individuals. Our results suggest that the {SOM} approach offers a well established methodology that can be easily applied to complex sociological data sets. The {SOM} outcomes are discussed in relation to other research about identifying others and forming relationships in a network society.},

We employ individual and municipality level data of some 30,000 marriages in over 40 municipalities in the Dutch province Overijssel between 1823 and 1922. The results from our multi-level analyses suggest that mass communication was more important than mass transport.},

	abstract = {Cupid may have wings, but apparently they are not adapted for long ﬂights.’ Studies on the spatial dimension of the partner market have found that the number of marriages declines as the distance between potential spouses increases. This paper explores the role of geographical distance in partner choice in the Netherlands. The availability of unique integral micro data from the population register enables us to study spatial homogamy among all new cohabiters. Spatial homogamy is measured by calculating distances between partners before cohabitation. The explorative study shows that geography matters: Dutch persons choose spatially homogamous partners. Spatial homogamy is inﬂuenced by demographic factors. With increasing age, spatial homogamy increases. Moreover, those who live with their parents and those who are single parents before cohabitation live signiﬁcantly shorter to their future partners. Spatial homogamy also exhibits a distinct spatial pattern. However, conditional on population size and geographical location, long distances between partners in peripheral areas become insigniﬁcant. Finally, the distance between partners decreases as urbanisation increases. The ﬁndings stimulate the discussion on the role of cultural factors in partner choice.

We argue that understanding polygenic scores, including their genetic correlations with each other, causation, and underlying biological architecture, is vital. We show how genetics can be introduced to understand a myriad of topics such as fertility, educational attainment, intergenerational social mobility, well-being, addiction, risky behavior, and longevity. Although models of gene-environment interaction and correlation mirror agency and structure models in sociology, genetics is yet to be fully discovered by this discipline. We conclude with a critical reflection on the lack of diversity, nonrepresentative samples, precision policy applications, ethics, and genetic determinism. We argue that sociogenomics can speak to long-standing sociological questions and that sociologists can offer innovative theoretical, measurement, and methodological innovations to genetic research.},

This study examines the association between educational level and completed fertility in a sample of Finnish male and female twins born between 1950 and 1957 with register-based fertility follow-up until 2009. The results show that poorly educated men and highly educated women are least likely to have any children and have lower completed fertility in general. Behavioral genetics analysis suggests that the association between education and having any children in both sexes is influenced by factors shared by co-twins and that these factors are genetic rather than common environmental. No evidence of a causal pathway between education and having any children independent of these shared influences is found. These findings suggest that familial factors may play a role in the process through which educational differences in completed fertility are formed.},

Thousands of conditions caused by single genes (Mendelian diseases) have been identified over the last century. However, Mendelian diseases are rare; thus, few individuals directly benefit from gene identification. In contrast, common complex diseases, such as obesity, breast cancer, and depression, directly affect many more individuals. Common complex diseases are caused by multiple genes, environmental factors, and/or interaction of genetic and environmental factors. This article provides a framework for the successful conduct of gene—environment studies. To accomplish this goal, the basic study designs and procedures of implementation for gene—environment interaction are described. Next, examples of gene—environment interaction in obesity epidemiology are reviewed. Last, the authors review reasons why epidemiological studies that incorporate gene—environment interaction have been unable to demonstrate statistically significant interactions and why conflicting results are reported.},

We make a general distinction between those methods and tools designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present results to others. We argue that recent advances should be seen as part of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between researchers and with wider publics, and we encourage practitioners and publishers to work toward a higher and more consistent standard for the graphical display of sociological insights.},

However, little attention has been devoted to the development of efficient design strategies for sibling studies in terms of optimizing power. We here address this issue in commonly encountered types of sibling studies, allowing for continuous and binary outcomes and varying numbers of exposed and unexposed siblings. For continuous outcomes, we show that in families with sibling pairs, optimal study power is obtained by recruiting discordant (exposed–control) pairs of siblings. More generally, balancing the exposure status within each family as evenly as possible is shown to be optimal. For binary outcomes, we elucidate how the optimal strategy depends on the variation of the binary response; as the within-family correlation increases, the optimal strategy tends toward only recruiting discordant sibling pairs (as in the case of continuous outcomes). R code for obtaining the optimal strategies is included.},

            Researchers continue to question fathers’ willingness to report their biological children in surveys and the ability of surveys to adequately represent fathers. To address these concerns, this study evaluates the quality of men’s fertility data in the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}79 and {NLSY}97) and in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth ({NSFG}). Comparing fertility rates in each survey with population rates based on data from Vital Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, we document how the incomplete reporting of births in different surveys varies according to men’s characteristics, including their age, race, marital status, and birth cohort. In addition, we use Monte Carlo simulations based on the {NSFG} data to demonstrate how birth underreporting biases associations between early parenthood and its antecedents. We find that in the {NSFG}, roughly four out of five early births were reported; but in the {NLSY}79 and {NLSY}97, almost nine-tenths of early births were reported. In all three surveys, incomplete reporting was especially pronounced for nonmarital births. Our results suggest that the quality of male fertility data is strongly linked to survey design and that it has implications for models of early male fertility.},

	abstract = {Background: Fathers’ experiences across the transition to parenthood are underreported in the literature. Social media offers the potential to capture fathers’ experiences in real time and at scale while also removing the barriers that fathers typically face in participating in research and clinical care.
Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using social media data to map the discussion topics of fathers across the fatherhood transition.
Methods: Discussion threads from two Web-based parenting communities, r/Daddit and r/{PreDaddit} from the social media platform Reddit, were collected over a 2-week period, resulting in 1980 discussion threads contributed to by 5853 unique users. An unsupervised machine learning algorithm was then implemented to group discussion threads into topics within each community and across a combined collection of all discussion threads.
Results: Results demonstrated that men use Web-based communities to share the joys and challenges of the fatherhood experience. Minimal overlap in discussions was found between the 2 communities, indicating that distinct conversations are held on each forum. A range of social support techniques was demonstrated, with conversations characterized by encouragement, humor, and experience-based advice.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that rich data on fathers’ experiences can be sourced from social media and analyzed rapidly using automated techniques, providing an additional tool for researchers exploring fatherhood.},

Overall, our results suggest that Italian couples are neither fully traditional nor entirely modern: the "first pillar" (i.e., a male partner with a stable and well-paid job) is still crucial in directing fertility decisions, because, in our interpretation, it gives the household a feeling of (relative) economic security. But this “old” family typology is becoming rare. Increasingly, both partners are employed, and in this case the characteristics of their employment prove important.

An event history analysis of 117 young men’s transitions to first-time parenthood is integrated with a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews on parenthood aspirations that were conducted with 12 childless participants from the same survey. The juxtaposition of both (sub)sampling and results shows, on the one hand, that men’s causal motivated actions to enter into fatherhood can be concluded by combining both qualitative and quantitative interpretations. On the other hand, causal effects on the transition to first-time fatherhood due to partnership selectivity can be concluded from quantitative factors that do not have a qualitative equivalent.},

This longitudinal study examines {BMI} in young men over time as they transition from adolescence into fatherhood in a nationally representative sample. Data from all four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health supported a 20-year longitudinal analysis of 10,253 men beginning in 1994. A “fatherhood-year” data set was created and changes in {BMI} were examined based on fatherhood status (nonfather, nonresident father, resident father), fatherhood years, and covariates. Though age is positively associated with {BMI} over all years for all men, comparing nonresident and resident fathers with nonfathers reveals different trajectories based on fatherhood status. Entrance into fatherhood is associated with an increase in {BMI} trajectory for both nonresident and resident fathers, while nonfathers exhibit a decrease over the same period. In this longitudinal, population-based study, fatherhood and residence status play a role in men’s {BMI}. Designing obesity prevention interventions for young men that begin in adolescence and carry through young adulthood should target the distinctive needs of these populations, potentially improving their health outcomes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} As many of the advanced countries that were hit hard by the recent economic recession also have persistently low fertility rates, researchers are increasingly interested in examining how the education‒employment gradient shapes fertility outcomes.
{OBJECTIVE} Our aim in this paper is to enrich the discussion about variation in crisis-driven fertility patterns by focusing on male fertility, and by comparing the fertility behavioral patterns and the compositional factors of male and female fertility under “Great Recession” conditions.
{METHODS} We estimate the education- and employment-specific fertility rates of men and women for the 2000–2014 period in Greece. Using a mixed standardization and decomposition method, we estimate the influence of changes in educational levels and employment status on total male and female fertility, which we call the “compositional effect;” and of changes in fertility behavior, which we call the “fertility effect.”
{RESULTS} During the recent economic recession, the decline in fertility has been far from uniform across genders, educational levels, and employment statuses. Moreover, it appears that the changes in male and female fertility rates have been driven by different underlying forces. We find that among men, negative shifts in employability were exclusively responsible for the decline in fertility rates; whereas among women, changes in the {TFR} were steadily conditioned by the pure fertility effect.

Although mounting qualitative evidence argues that unmarried low-income men may be more favorably disposed to fatherhood than previously recognized and that such intentions may greatly influence subsequent fathering behavior, studies of fertility intention remain largely separate from those of father involvement.

	abstract = {Background: Male infertility is a widespread condition among couples. In about 50\% of cases, couple infertility is attributable to the male partner, mainly due to a failure in spermatogenesis. In recent times, the crucial role that modifiable lifestyle factors play in the development of infertility have generated a growing interest in this field of study, i.e. aging, psychological stress, nutrition, physical activity, caffeine, high scrotal temperature, hot water, mobile telephone use. Several studies have investigated associations between semen quality and the presence of lifestyle stressors i.e. occupational, life events (war, earthquake, etc.) or couple infertility; overall, these studies provide evidence that semen quality is impaired by psychological stress. In this review, we will discuss the impact of quality of life (modifiable lifestyle factors) and psychological stress on male fertility. In addition, the role that increased scrotal temperature along with inappropriate nutritional and physical exercise attitudes exert on male fertility will be presented. Conclusion: The decline of male fertility, particularly associated with advancing age, incorrect lifestyles and environmental factors plays an important role on natality, and its consequences on the future on human population makes this an important public health issue in this century. Thus, modification of lifestyle through a structured program of educational, environmental, nutritional/physical exercise and psychological support, combined with the use of nutraceutical antioxidants can prevent infertility and therefore, may help couples to obtain better quality of life and improved possibility to conceive spontaneously or optimize their chances of conception.},

            With the rise in out-of-wedlock childbearing and divorce in the last quarter of the twentieth century, an increasing proportion of children have been exposed to a variety of new family forms. Little research has focused on the consequences of childhood family structure for men’s transition to fatherhood or on the family processes that account for the effects of family structure on the likelihood that young women and men become first-time unmarried parents, what we now call “fragile families.” The data come from the linked Children and Young Adult samples of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ({NLSY}79), which provide information on the children of the women of the {NLSY}79 from birth until they enter young adulthood. Females growing up with a single parent and males experiencing an unstable family transition to parenthood early, particularly to nonresidential fatherhood for males. For males, the effects are strongly mediated by parenting processes and adolescent behaviors and are shaped by economic circumstances. Having experienced multiple transitions as a child is associated with a reduced likelihood that males father their first child within marriage and an increased likelihood that they become fathers within cohabitation, demonstrating how changes in family structure alter family structure patterns over time and generations.},

The analysis shows that fertility levels in a region are strongly related to gross domestic product per capita and the share of divorced individuals in the region, and fertility levels in neighbouring regions, supporting that all three realms of fertility determinants—economic, sociocultural, and spatial—are relevant for understanding modern fertility variation.},

Employment instab­ il­ity, which most often man­i­fests in unem­ploym­ ent or time-lim­ited employm­ ent, is usua­lly deemed to have a nega­­tive effect on fer­til­ity, although dif­fer­ent fer­til­ity reac­tions are hypoth­e­sized by socio­log­i­cal the­o­ries, and micro-level evi­dence is fragmented and con­tra­dic­tory. We used metaana­lytic tech­niques to syn­the­size Euro­pean research find­ings, offer gen­eral con­clu­sions about the effects of employm­ ent instab­ il­ity on fert­ili­ty (in terms of direct­ion and size), and rank dif­fer­ent sources of employm­ ent instab­ il­ity. Our results sugg­ est that employ­ ment instab­ ili­ty has a nonnegligible nega­ t­ive effect on fert­ili­ty. Men’s unem­ploy­ment is more det­ri­men­tal for fer­tili­ty than men’s time-lim­ited employ­ment; con­versely, a woman hav­ing a fixed-term con­tract is least likely to have a child. Next, the neg­a­tive effect of employm­ ent instability on fert­ili­ty has become stronger over time, and is more severe in Southern Europ­ ean countries, where social prot­ect­ion for fami­­lies and the unemp­ loyed is least gene­ r­ous. Finally, meta-regress­ ion esti­ma­tes demo­ n­strate that faili­ng to account for income and part­ner char­ac­ter­is­tics leads to an over­es­ti­mat­ion of the neg­a­tive effect of employ­ment instab­ il­ity on fert­ili­ty. We advance the role of these two fact­ors as poten­tial mecha­ ­nisms by which employm­ ent instab­ il­ity affects fert­ili­ty.

	abstract = {The present study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the relation between employment instability and union dissolution. To address the oversights of previous research, we disentangle the effect of employment instability on union dissolution by: (i) considering not only the effect of joblessness, but also the type of employment contract; (ii) evaluating both status and the accumulation of instability over the life course; and (iii) detecting gender differences. We focus on Italy, applying event-history techniques to the most recent Italian Multipurpose Survey “Families, social subjects and life cycle” of 2016, observing cohorts from 1950 to 1986. Our results suggest that the effect of employment instability on union dissolution is gender-specific: joblessness and limited-time employment are facilitators for men’s dissolution, while, for women, joblessness is an inhibitor for dissolution, and time-limited and permanent employment do not substantially differ. We also highlight the crucial role of the persistence of instability in unpacking the association between employment instability and union dissolution. This paper advances—for the first time for Italy, at least—that men’s time-limited employment arrangements negatively affect a couple’s stability.},

This article investigates the impact of job instability on the fertility intentions of young adults in Europe, focusing on employment protection legislation ({EPL}) in European countries. I use data from twenty-seven countries that participated in the European Social Survey in 2004 and 2010 to show that job instability measured as temporary employment, informal work, and unemployment decreases fertility intentions among European youth regardless of the {EPL} in the country. Unemployed young adults tend to plan less for having their first child in the countries with high {EPL}. Contrary to the hypotheses, multilevel modeling showed that young people in temporary or informal employment in countries with low {EPL} show decreases in their fertility intentions.},

First, we found a high variation in the studied effects among the institutional settings, reﬂecting the existence of a north–south gradient. Second, we observed a signiﬁcant change in the effects over time.

We argue that one reason for this is that the complexity of the concept of gender equality has received insufﬁcient attention. Gender equality needs to be conceptualized in a manner that goes beyond perceiving it as mere ‘‘sameness of distribution’’. It needs to include notions of gender equity and thus to allow for distinguishing between gender difference and gender inequality. We sketch three dimensions of gender equality related to employment, ﬁnancial resources, and family work, which incorporate this understanding: (1) the ability to maintain a household; (2) agency and the capability to choose; and (3) gender equity in household and care work. We explore their impact on childbearing intentions of women and men using the European Generations and Gender Surveys. Our results conﬁrm the need for a more nuanced notion of gender equality in studies on the relationship between gender equality on fertility. They show that there is no uniform effect of gender equality on childbearing intentions, but that the impact varies by gender and by parity.},

The aim of this article is to investigate how gender-specific differences in family formation have changed over time, and more particularly, whether these differences have disappeared in recent years. We use a large-scale survey (more than 240,000 men and women born after 1940) conducted within the French 1999 census and apply event history techniques. The sample size allows us to test our hypotheses with more sophisticated models that cover several interactions. Our data fully support the convergence hypothesis for men and women with regard to the effects of educational attainment and working status (working/not working). However, it is only partly relevant for the effects of their school enrolment status on entry into first union and parenthood. For both men and women, the impact of work experience on first union disappears over time, but remains important for first parenthood.},

	abstract = {Subnational differences in male fertility within sub-Saharan African countries have not been explored, nor the differences in male fertility according to migration status been sufficiently probed. We study divergences in rural and urban male fertility and investigate the relationship between male fertility and migration across 30 sub-Saharan African countries. We employ 67 Demographic and Health Surveys to estimate completed cohort fertility among men aged 50–64 according to migration status. Overall, we find that urban male fertility has declined faster than rural male fertility, widening the gap between the sectors. Rural-urban migrant men have lower fertility than their rural non-migrant counterparts. Men migrating within the rural sector have similarly high fertility as rural non-migrants, while urban–urban migrant men have even lower fertility than non-migrant urban men. Using country-fixed effects models, we find that among men with at least secondary education, differences in completed cohort fertility by migration status are widest. When we consider the timing of migration in relation to the timing of the birth of the last child, we observe that migrant men are a select group, having around two children less than non-migrant rural men. There is also evidence of adaptation to destination, though to a lesser extent. Furthermore, migration within the rural sector does not seem to be disruptive to fathering. These results indicate that rural-to-urban migration has the potential to delay rural fertility decline, and that urban male fertility is likely to decline further, especially as the proportion of urban-to-urban migration increases.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examine whether the long-term structural changes in the labour market, driven by automation, affect fertility. The adoption of industrial robots is used as a proxy for these changes. It has tripled since the mid-1990s in the {EU}, tremendously changing the conditions of participating in the labour market. On the one hand, new jobs are created, benefitting largely the highly skilled workers. On the other hand, the growing turnover in the labour market and changing content of jobs induce fears of job displacement and make workers continuously adjust to new requirements (reskill, upskill, increase work efforts). The consequences of these changes are particularly strong for the employment and earning prospects of low and middle-educated workers. Our focus is on six European countries: Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the {UK}. We link regional data on fertility and employment structures by industry from Eurostat ({NUTS}-2) with data on robot adoption from the International Federation of Robotics. We estimate fixed effects linear models with instrumental variables in order to account for the external shocks which may affect fertility and robot adoption in parallel. Our findings suggest robots tend to exert a negative impact on fertility in highly industrialised regions, regions with relatively low educated populations and those which are technologically less advanced. At the same time, better educated and prospering regions may even experience fertility improvements as a result of technological change. The family and labour market institutions of the country may further moderate these effects.},

Moreover, the upturn in the {TFR} was not confined to lowest-fertility countries, but affected the whole developed world. We explore the demographic explanations for the recent rise in {TFRs} stemming from fertility timing effects as well as economic, policy, and social factors. Although the current economic downturn may suppress {TFRs} in the short run, we conclude that formerly lowest-low-fertility countries will continue to see increases in fertility as the transitory effects of shifts to later childbearing become less important.},

	abstract = {Abstract Sweden was well equipped to prevent the pandemic of {COVID}-19 from becoming serious. Over 280 years of collaboration between political bodies, authorities, and the scientific community had yielded many successes in preventive medicine. Sweden’s population is literate and has a high level of trust in authorities and those in power. During 2020, however, Sweden had ten times higher {COVID}-19 death rates compared with neighbouring Norway. In this report, we try to understand why, using a narrative approach to evaluate the Swedish {COVID}-19 policy and the role of scientific evidence and integrity. We argue that that scientific methodology was not followed by the major figures in the acting authorities—or the responsible politicians—with alternative narratives being considered as valid, resulting in arbitrary policy decisions. In 2014, the Public Health Agency merged with the Institute for Infectious Disease Control; the first decision by its new head (Johan Carlson) was to dismiss and move the authority’s six professors to Karolinska Institute. With this setup, the authority lacked expertise and could disregard scientific facts. The Swedish pandemic strategy seemed targeted towards “natural” herd-immunity and avoiding a societal shutdown. The Public Health Agency labelled advice from national scientists and international authorities as extreme positions, resulting in media and political bodies to accept their own policy instead. The Swedish people were kept in ignorance of basic facts such as the airborne {SARS}-{CoV}-2 transmission, that asymptomatic individuals can be contagious and that face masks protect both the carrier and others. Mandatory legislation was seldom used; recommendations relying upon personal responsibility and without any sanctions were the norm. Many elderly people were administered morphine instead of oxygen despite available supplies, effectively ending their lives. If Sweden wants to do better in future pandemics, the scientific method must be re-established, not least within the Public Health Agency. It would likely make a large difference if a separate, independent Institute for Infectious Disease Control is recreated. We recommend Sweden begins a self-critical process about its political culture and the lack of accountability of decision-makers to avoid future failures, as occurred with the {COVID}-19 pandemic.},

When expectations cannot be anchored in objective probability functions, the future belongs to those with the market, political, or rhetorical power to make their models or stories count.

However, the population registers have some traits which may impact on the representativeness of the samples. The authors argue that, if researchers are aware of the caveats, registers can be used to obtain representative samples of immigrants, and register data can be complemented with survey-based attitudinal data, thus opening up new research opportunities for testing propositions on integration theories.},

People move freely between Sweden and Finland, as they are in the common Nordic labour market. Event history analysis shows that many moves are temporary and short term. Moreover, the patterns of circular migration reflect those of the first emigration and first return, respectively. Swedish speakers and individuals who are not married are more prone to emigrate for the first and second time, whereas Finnish speakers and married individuals have a higher risk of return migration. This implies that circular migration may amplify demographic features related to emigration and return migration.},

Data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women. We ﬁnd early childbearing to be associated with higher mortality among whites, while later childbearing is associated with higher mortality among blacks. The effect of age at ﬁrst birth on white women’s mortality is explained by background and mediating social, economic, and health related factors, but this effect remains robust for black women. In addition, childless white women have a higher risk of post-reproductive mortality than those with 2–3 children. High parity (6þ children) has a signiﬁcant protective effect for blacks, though the effect is reduced with age. A similar protective effect of high parity becomes apparent among whites only after controlling for background and mediating characteristics. Findings are interpreted in light of the weathering hypothesis and from a life course framework that views women’s fertility as adaptive to particular social and historical contexts.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on male family situation and premature mortality. For a total of 682,919 men, we analysed mortality from different causes (1991–2000) among lone fathers, with and without custody of their children, and among childless men, with and without partners. Long-term cohabiting fathers with a child in their household were used as comparison group. We employed data from Swedish censuses, national health-data registers, and a Swedish register containing information about known biological relations between children and parents. We investigated the extent to which different kinds of relations were inﬂuenced by varying socioeconomic circumstances between groups, and also processes of health selection. The results suggest that lone non-custodial fathers and lone childless men face the greatest increase in risks, especially from injury and addiction, and also from all-cause mortality and ischaemic heart disease. Being a lone custodial father also entails increased risk, although generally to a much lesser extent, and not for all outcomes. The elevated risks found in all the subgroups considered diminished substantially when proxy variables to control for health-selection effects and socioeconomic circumstances were added to the initial model. Risks fell most in response to introduction of the socioeconomic variables, but health selection also played a major role, mostly in the cases of lone non-custodial fathers and lone childless men. However, even following these adjustments, signiﬁcant risk increases, although greatly attenuated, remained for all the subgroups.},

{OBJECTIVE} The present study assesses whether the migration slowdown in the United States was primarily driven by period effects or by cohort effects.
{METHODS} Using 46 waves of data across the 1964–2019 Annual Social and Economic Supplements to the Current Population Survey, I estimate a series of mixed-effects models predicting the probability of moving and a linear model with age x period interaction terms predicting the probability of moving.
{RESULTS} Cohort effects are more salient in slowing the rates of migration than are period effects. The migration slowdown occurred in part because members of the Silent and Baby Boom generations, who had a higher probability of moving at all ages, matured out of their prime years of geographic mobility in young adulthood and were replaced successively by members of Generation X, the Millennial generation, and Generation Z, who comparatively have a lower probability of moving.

Differences in data collection, in geography and in measurement intervals seriously hinder rigorous cross-national comparisons. We supplement data from the University of Minnesota {IPUMS} collection to make comparisons between 28 countries using both five year and lifetime measures of migration, and focusing particularly on migration intensity and spatial impacts. We demonstrate that Courgeau's k (Courgeau 1973) provides a powerful mechanism to transcend differences in statistical geography. Our results reveal widespread differences in the intensity of migration, and in the ages at which it occurs, with Asia generally displaying low mobility and sharp, early peaks, whereas Latin America and the Developed Countries show higher mobility and flatter age profiles usually peaking at older ages. High mobility is commonly offset by corresponding counter-flows but redistribution through internal migration is substantial in some countries, especially when computed as a lifetime measure. Time series comparisons show five year migration intensities falling in most countries (China being a notable exception), although lifetime data show more widespread rises due to age structure effects. Globally, we estimate that 740 million people, one in eight, were living within their home country but outside their region of birth, substantially above the commonly cited figure of 200 million international migrants.},

Our results reveal widespread differences in the intensity of migration, and in the ages at which it occurs, with Asia generally displaying low mobility and sharp, early peaks, whereas Latin America and the Developed Countries show higher mobility and flatter age profiles usually peaking at older ages. High mobility is commonly offset by corresponding counter-flows but redistribution through internal migration is substantial in some countries, especially when computed as a lifetime measure. Time series comparisons show five year migration intensities falling in most countries (China being a notable exception), although lifetime data show more widespread rises due to age structure effects. Globally, we estimate that 740 million people, one in eight, were living within their home country but outside their region of birth, substantially above the commonly cited figure of 200 million international migrants.},

The results indicate that the pattern of labour market-related migration has changed as more migrants today migrate at an age prior to having become established on the labour market. The increase in interregional migration is to a large extent an effect of increased student migration. The study further shows that changed household structures have also had an impact on migration patterns during the studied period.

For a total of 682,919 men, we analysed mortality from different causes (1991–2000) among lone fathers, with and without custody of their children, and among childless men, with and without partners. Long-term cohabiting fathers with a child in their household were used as comparison group. We employed data from Swedish censuses, national health-data registers, and a Swedish register containing information about known biological relations between children and parents. We investigated the extent to which different kinds of relations were inﬂuenced by varying socioeconomic circumstances between groups, and also processes of health selection. The results suggest that lone non-custodial fathers and lone childless men face the greatest increase in risks, especially from injury and addiction, and also from all-cause mortality and ischaemic heart disease. Being a lone custodial father also entails increased risk, although generally to a much lesser extent, and not for all outcomes. The elevated risks found in all the subgroups considered diminished substantially when proxy variables to control for health-selection effects and socioeconomic circumstances were added to the initial model. Risks fell most in response to introduction of the socioeconomic variables, but health selection also played a major role, mostly in the cases of lone non-custodial fathers and lone childless men. However, even following these adjustments, signiﬁcant risk increases, although greatly attenuated, remained for all the subgroups.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that reproductive history inﬂuences post-reproductive mortality. A potential explanation for this association is confounding by socioeconomic status in the family of origin, as socioeconomic status is related to both fertility behaviours and to long-term health. We examine the relationship between age at ﬁrst birth, completed parity, and post-reproductive mortality and address the potential confounding role of family of origin. We use Swedish population register data for men and women born 1932e1960, and examine both all-cause and cause-speciﬁc mortality. The contributions of our study are the use of a sibling comparison design that minimizes residual confounding from shared family background characteristics and assessment of cause-speciﬁc mortality that can shed light on the mechanisms linking reproductive history to mortality. Our results were entirely consistent with previous research on this topic, with teenage ﬁrst time parents having higher mortality, and the relationship between parity and mortality following a U-shaped pattern where childless men and women and those with ﬁve or more children had the highest mortality. These results indicate that selection into speciﬁc fertility behaviours based upon socioeconomic status and experiences within the family of origin does not explain the relationship between reproductive history and post-reproductive mortality. Additional analyses where we adjust for other lifecourse factors such as educational attainment, attained socioeconomic status, and post-reproductive marital history do not change the results. Our results add an important new level of robustness to the ﬁndings on reproductive history and mortality by showing that the association is robust to confounding by factors shared by siblings. However it is still uncertain whether reproductive history causally inﬂuences health, or whether other confounding factors such as childhood health or risk-taking propensity could explain the association.},

	abstract = {The relationship between women's reproductive histories and later all-cause mortality has been investigated in several studies, with mixed results. Some studies have also considered cause-speciﬁc mortality and some have included men, but none has done both. We analyse associations between parity and age of ﬁrst birth for women and men across 11 cause-of-death groupings using Norwegian register data for complete cohorts born 1935e1968 whose mortality was observed 1980e2003 (i.e. at ages 45e68). Age, period, educational level, marital status, region of residence and population size of municipality were included as co-variates. In total, there were 63,000 deaths. Results showed that relative to parents of two children, childless men and women and those with one child had higher mortality risks for nearly all cause of death groupings. High parity (4þ children) was associated with raised male mortality from accidents and violence and higher mortality from cancer of the cervix among women. For other cause and gender groupings there was either little difference between those with two children and those of higher parities or an overall negative association between parity and mortality. Among men with the lowest level of education, however, high parity was positively associated with mortality from circulatory diseases. For all causes except female breast cancer, there was an inverse association between age at ﬁrst birth and mortality risk. Similarities observed across cause groups and for women and men suggest that much of the fertilityemortality relationship is a result of selection or effects of reproductive behaviour on lifestyle. The latter may include both beneﬁcial effects and harmful stress responses. However, physiological mechanisms are most probably important for some causes of death for women. Research on associations between parenting histories, health related behaviours, social support exchanges and reported or measured stress is needed to clarify mechanisms underlying the associations reported here.

We ﬁnd early childbearing to be associated with higher mortality among whites, while later childbearing is associated with higher mortality among blacks. The effect of age at ﬁrst birth on white women’s mortality is explained by background and mediating social, economic, and health related factors, but this effect remains robust for black women. In addition, childless white women have a higher risk of post-reproductive mortality than those with 2–3 children. High parity (6þ children) has a signiﬁcant protective effect for blacks, though the effect is reduced with age. A similar protective effect of high parity becomes apparent among whites only after controlling for background and mediating characteristics. Findings are interpreted in light of the weathering hypothesis and from a life course framework that views women’s fertility as adaptive to particular social and historical contexts.},

	shorttitle = {‘No longer invincible’},
	abstract = {Background: The global trend of declining fertility rates and an increasingly ageing population has led to increased scrutiny of parenthood. Although there are more childless men than childless women, there is very little research literature on the impact of male childlessness. The childless are absent from much social science literature, which has mainly focussed on family and women. Feminist studies into infertility and ageing have highlighted the absence of the male experience. Involuntary childlessness has been viewed as a complex bereavement formed by multiple losses. Distress levels in both men and women in this population have been found to be as high those with grave medical conditions.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine older men’s experience of involuntary childlessness.
Methods: This piece draws on my qualitative auto/biographical doctoral study that was framed by biographical, life course, gerontological, and feminist approaches. Data collection involved in-depth semi-structured biographical interviews with 14 self-defined involuntary childless men aged between 49 and 82 years from across the United Kingdom. A latent thematic analysis highlighted the complex intersections between agency, biology, childlessness, economics, mental and physical health, relationships, and socio-cultural structures. Major findings: Findings countered the stereotype that men are not interested in reproduction. I argue that that involuntary childlessness should be considered as a significant factor in older men’s poor health and social capital.
Conclusions: This piece challenges the common narratives that the social, emotional, and relational aspects of involuntary childlessness do not affect men.},

The aim of the present review is to update the current knowledge base regarding the association between male factor infertility and general health through a critical review of the literature. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out from inception to November 2019 in order to evaluate significant associations between male infertility and adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular, oncologic, metabolic and autoimmune diseases as well as overall mortality.
Results: In all, 27 studies met inclusion criteria and were critically examined. Five studies examined male infertility and cardiovascular disease risk, 11 examined oncologic risk (e.g., overall cancer risk, testis and prostate cancer), 8 examined aggregate chronic medical diseases and 5 infertility related to incidence of mortality, for a total of 599,807 men diagnosed with any male factor infertility covering a period from 1916 to 2016.
Conclusions: A man’s fertility and overall health appear to be interconnected. Therefore, a diagnosis of male infertility may allow a window into future comorbidity and/or mortality which may help guide clinical decisions and counseling. Several possible etiologies such as genetic, epigenetic, developmental, and lifestyle-based factors need to be further evaluated in order to establish the underlying mechanisms between male infertility and health.},

Data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women. We ﬁnd early childbearing to be associated with higher mortality among whites, while later childbearing is associated with higher mortality among blacks. The effect of age at ﬁrst birth on white women’s mortality is explained by background and mediating social, economic, and health related factors, but this effect remains robust for black women. In addition, childless white women have a higher risk of post-reproductive mortality than those with 2–3 children. High parity (6þ children) has a signiﬁcant protective effect for blacks, though the effect is reduced with age. A similar protective effect of high parity becomes apparent among whites only after controlling for background and mediating characteristics. Findings are interpreted in light of the weathering hypothesis and from a life course framework that views women’s fertility as adaptive to particular social and historical contexts.},

Among men in first marriages, the childless have 36 percent higher mortality than those with two or more children. The corresponding figure for women is 61 percent. The never-married have higher mortality and are differentiated even more by parenthood status. Thus, childless never-married men and women have mortality three times as high as those who are married and have two or more children. The apparent advantage associated with having at least two children is smallest among men who divorced before their oldest child's tenth birthday. Having step-children has no association with mortality for those without natural children but is associated with higher mortality among the parous.},

	abstract = {Hearing loss as well as being single has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. The purpose of the study is to assess whether being single or childless moderates the elevated risk of mortality in hearing impaired. The Nord-Trøndelag hearing Loss Study examined 50,462 persons above 20 years of age during 1996–1998. The Norwegian Cause of Death Registry was used to identify deaths until 2016. Data on marital status was obtained from the Norwegian Population Registry. Hearing loss was defined as the pure-tone average (0.5–4 {kHz}) of hearing thresholds greater than 25 {dB} hearing level ({dB} {HL}) in the better ear. Associations between hearing loss and mortality risk were estimated using Cox regression after an average follow-up of 17.6 years. Hearing loss was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality before 75 years of age (hazard ratio [{HR}] 1.3, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 1.2–1.4) and cardiovascular mortality ({HR} 1.8, 95\% {CI} 1.5–2.1) but not with cancer mortality ({HR} 1.1, 95\% {CI} 0.9–1.3) or mortality due to injuries ({HR} 1.4, 95\% {CI} 0.9–2.3). Adjusting for socio-economic characteristics, cardiovascular risk-factors, diseases, and family status, reduced the associations for all-cause mortality ({HR} 1.1, 95\% {CI} 1.0–1.2) and cardiovascular mortality ({HR} 1.4, 95\% {CI} 1.2–1.6). The adjusted mortality risk was found to be significantly related to family status. Being divorced raised the mortality risk associated with hearing loss among those below 75 years of age. There was a similar tendency also for being childless, although this was only significant for females. There was also a trend for a lower mortality related to hearing loss in subjects with a well-hearing partner. More focus should be given to those who lack a family when having functional limitations such as hearing impairment.},

	abstract = {While levels of migration within countries have been trending down in a number of advanced economies, Sweden has recorded a rise in internal migration among young adults. An increase in aggregate migration levels can be the result of a decline in immobility (i.e. the absence of migration), an increase in repeat movement or a combination of both. In this paper, we draw on retrospective survey and longitudinal register data to explore the demographic mechanisms underpinning the rise in internal migration among young Swedes born in the 30 years to 1980 and we compare the migration behaviour of the youngest cohort to that of their European counterparts. Of all 25 European countries, Sweden reports the highest level of migration among young adults, which is the result of very low immobility combined with high repeat movement. The increase in migration has been particularly pronounced for inter-county moves for the post-1970 cohorts. Analysis of order-specific components of migration shows that this is the result of a decrease in immobility combined with a modest rise in higher-order moves, whereas it is the rise in higher-order moves that underpins the increase in inter-parish migration. This upswing has been accompanied by a shift in the ages at migration, characterised by an earlier start and later finish leading to a lengthening of the number of years young adults are mobile. The results indicate that change in migration behaviour is order-specific, which underlines the need to collect and analyse migration by move order to obtain a reliable account of migration trends.},

Our measures remove the former distortion and provide means to assess the latter aging effect. The measures therefore provide a uniﬁed toolkit of fertility indices that (a) facilitate the description and analysis of past period fertility trends in terms of synthetic cohort measures, and (b) allow the projection of the timing, level and distribution of cohort fertility conditional on a speciﬁc postponement scenario. Due to their explicit relation to cohort behavior, these measures extend and improve the existing adjustment of the total fertility rate. We apply these methods to Sweden from 1970 to 1999.},

The dynamics underpinning these trends remain poorly understood because they are analyzed almost exclusively by applying period measures to cross-sectional data. This article proposes 10 cohort measures that can be applied to both prospective and retrospective data to systematically examine long-term trends. To demonstrate their benefits, the proposed measures are applied to retrospective survey data for England that provide residential histories from birth to age 50 for cohorts bom between 1918 and 1957. The analysis reveals stable lifetime migration for men but increased lifetime migration for women associated with earlier ages at moving in adulthood and a compression of intervals between consecutive moves. The proposed cohort measures provide a more comprehensive picture of migration behavior and should be used to complement period measures in exploring long-term trends. Increasing availability of retrospective and longitudinal survey data means that researchers can now apply the proposed measures to a wide range of countries.},

	abstract = {Many studies have reported evidence of negative associations between fixed-term contract employment and fertility. With few exceptions, these studies assume that employment status is exogenous and thus results are likely biased. Furthermore, previous research has mostly not considered whether the effects of employment status on fertility might vary with other worker characteristics. We draw on nineteen years of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey to investigate the causal effect of contingent forms of employment (including both fixed-term and casual employment) on first births, and how that effect varies with selected worker characteristics. The issue of endogeneity is addressed through the use of instrumental variables estimation. Our main finding is that both fixed-term contracts and casual employment lead to a significantly lower probability of first births among men, with the effect of fixed-term contracts being almost as twice as large as the effect of casual employment. We also find that these negative fertility effects vary with workers’ education, occupational status, country of origin, age, and relationship status. In the case of women, one of the instruments fails to satisfy the exclusion restriction, suggesting endogeneity remains a concern when analyzing female fertility outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Increases in human longevity have made it critical to distinguish healthy longevity from longevity without regard to health. Current methods focus on expectations of healthy longevity, and are often limited to binary health outcomes (e.g., disabled vs. not disabled). We present a new matrix formulation for the statistics of healthy longevity, based on health prevalence data and Markov chain theory, applicable to any kind of health outcome and which provides variances and higher moments as well as expectations of healthy life.
Method: The model is based on a Markov chain description of the life course coupled with the moments of health outcomes (“rewards”) at each age or stage. As an example, we apply the method to nine European countries using the {SHARE} survey data on the binary outcome of disability as measured by activities of daily living, and the continuous health outcome of hand grip strength.
Results: We provide analytical formulas for the mean, variance, coefficient of variation, skewness and other statistical properties of healthy longevity. The analysis is applicable to binary, categorical, ordinal, or interval scale health outcomes. The results are easily evaluated in any matrix-oriented software. The {SHARE} results reveal familiar patterns for the expectation of life and of healthy life: women live longer than men but spend less time in a healthy condition. New results on the variance shows that the standard deviation of remaining healthy life declines with age, but the coefficient of variation is nearly constant. Remaining grip strength years decrease with age more dramatically than healthy years but their variability pattern is similar to the pattern of healthy years. Patterns are similar across nine European countries.
Conclusions: The method extends, in several directions, current calculations of health expectancy ({HE}) and disability-adjusted life years ({DALYs}). It applies to both categorical and continuous health outcomes, to combinations of multiple outcomes (e.g., death and disability in the formulation of {DALYs}) and to age- or stage-classified models. It reveals previously unreported patterns of variation among individuals in the outcomes of healthy longevity.},

	abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has not affected the population evenly. This must be acknowledged when it comes to understanding the Covid-19 death toll and answering the question of how many life years have been lost. We use level of geriatric care to account for variation in remaining life expectancy among individuals that died during 2020. Based on a linkage of administrative registers, we estimate remaining life expectancy stratified by age, sex, and care status using an incidence-based multistate model and analyze the number of years of life lost ({YLL}) during 2020 in Sweden. Our results show that remaining life expectancy between individuals with and without care differs substantially. More than half of all Covid-19 deaths had a remaining life expectancy lower than 4 years. Yet, in a 1-year perspective, Covid-19 did not seem to replace other causes of death. Not considering the differences in remaining life expectancy in the affected populations overestimated {YLL} by 40\% for women and 30\% for men, or around 2 years per death. While the unadjusted {YLL} from Covid-19 amounted to an average of 7.5 years for women and 8.6 years for men, the corresponding {YLL} adjusted for care status were 5.4 and 6.6, respectively. The total number of {YLL} to Covid-19 in 2020 is comparable to {YLL} from ischemic heart disease in 2019 and 2020. Our results urge the use of subgroup specific mortality when counting the burden of Covid-19. {YLL} are considerably reduced when the varying susceptibility for death is considered, but even if most lifespans were cut in the last years of life, the {YLL} are still substantial.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive theory for the demographic analysis of populations in which individuals are classified by both age and stage. The earliest demographic models were age classified. Ecologists adopted methods developed by human demographers and used life tables to quantify survivorship and fertility of cohorts and the growth rates and structures of populations. Later, motivated by studies of plants and insects, matrix population models structured by size or stage were developed. The theory of these models has been extended to cover all the aspects of age-classified demography and more. It is a natural development to consider populations classified by both age and stage. A steady trickle of results has appeared since the 1960s, analyzing one or another aspect of age 9 stage-classified populations, in both ecology and human demography. Here, we use the vec-permutation formulation of multistate matrix population models to incorporate age- and stage-specific vital rates into demographic analysis. We present cohort results for the life table functions (survivorship, mortality, and fertility), the dynamics of intracohort selection, the statistics of longevity, the joint distribution of age and stage at death, and the statistics of life disparity. Combining transitions and fertility yields a complete set of population dynamic results, including population growth rates and structures, net reproductive rate, the statistics of lifetime reproduction, and measures of generation time. We present a complete analysis of a hypothetical model species, inspired by poecilogonous marine invertebrates that produce two kinds of larval offspring. Given the joint effects of age and stage, many familiar demographic results become multidimensional, so calculations of marginal and mixture distributions are an important tool. From an age-classified point of view, stage structure is a form of unobserved heterogeneity. From a stage-classified point of view, age structure is unobserved heterogeneity. In an age 9 stage-classified model, variance in demographic outcomes can be partitioned into contributions from both sources. Because these models are formulated as matrices, they are amenable to a complete sensitivity analysis. As more detailed and longer longitudinal studies are developed, age 9 stage-classified demography will become more common and more important.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Maternal effect senescence, the decline in offspring quality with increasing maternal age, is common in animals despite its negative impact on fitness. To understand how maternal effect senescence might evolve, we built matrix population models to calculate selection gradients on survival and fertility as functions of maternal age. We estimated the model’s parameters with data from an aquatic invertebrate. The strength of selection eventually declines with age and maternal age, implying that maternal effect senescence could be favored by selection and evolve in the same way as senescence. Our framework can be applied to investigate maternal effect senescence in organisms with diverse life histories and unifies the demographic approaches to age-related and maternal effect senescence.
          , 
            
              Maternal effect senescence—a decline in offspring survival or fertility with maternal age—has been demonstrated in many taxa, including humans. Despite decades of phenotypic studies, questions remain about how maternal effect senescence impacts evolutionary fitness. To understand the influence of maternal effect senescence on population dynamics, fitness, and selection, we developed matrix population models in which individuals are jointly classified by age and maternal age. We fit these models to data from individual-based culture experiments on the aquatic invertebrate,
              Brachionus manjavacas
              (Rotifera). By comparing models with and without maternal effects, we found that maternal effect senescence significantly reduces fitness for
              B. manjavacas
              and that this decrease arises primarily through reduced fertility, particularly at maternal ages corresponding to peak reproductive output. We also used the models to estimate selection gradients, which measure the strength of selection, in both high growth rate (laboratory) and two simulated low growth rate environments. In all environments, selection gradients on survival and fertility decrease with increasing age. They also decrease with increasing maternal age for late maternal ages, implying that maternal effect senescence can evolve through the same process as in Hamilton’s theory of the evolution of age-related senescence. The models we developed are widely applicable to evaluate the fitness consequences of maternal effect senescence across species with diverse aging and fertility schedule phenotypes.},

The study pays special attention to both the human and social capital approach and aspects of intergenerational transmission and solidarity between generations. In line with the human capital theory, a strong increase in labour force participation can be noted among women belonging to the second migrant generation: Whereas only about 34 per cent of first generation immigrants participate in the workforce, the share among the second generation amounts to about 60 per cent. In addition to family status and education, mothers’ employment is found to increase the likelihood of the daughter’s participation in the workforce.

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate nationwide participation rates in back care programmes of the German working population.
Methods: From a national health survey conducted in Germany between October 1997 to March 1999 (n = 3313 employees aged 18 to 69), we investigated how participation in back care programmes correlates with sociodemographic characteristics, occupation, lifestyle and health factors.
Results: Approximately one out of six (17.5 \%) employee has ever attended a back care class. 7.2 \% took part in this kind of health promotion programme during the past year. After adjusting for various symptom prevalences, the survey revealed that males, full-time employees, singles and people with an unfavourable lifestyle were less likely to attend such programmes.
Conclusions: This paper is the first to provide representative data on uptake of back care classes and investigate the correlates of participation in back care programs in Germany. The study indicates that people with the highest risk for low back pain are the least likely to take back care classes.},
